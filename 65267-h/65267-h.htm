<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">This</span> book is intended for young people who are
beginning to take an interest in historical subjects,
and it may also be acceptable to those who are too
busy with their daily work to find much time or
opportunity for continuing, as they would like a full
course of study. Many people have not the leisure
to read a three-volume biography, and so they miss
knowing anything at all about some of the great
figures in history.</p>

<p>We have tried here to tell quite simply the story
of the lives of a dozen great men, some of whom may
not be very familiar.</p>

<p>There are many books about men of action—soldiers,
sailors, and explorers—but it is not so easy
to find any simple account of men who have used
their minds and their pens, rather than the sword,
in the work for the betterment of their country to
which they have devoted their lives.</p>

<p>We have chosen men who are not actually connected
with one another in any way. But although
they lived in different lands and in different centuries,
they are linked by the same qualities; the same
strain runs through them all of fearlessness, moral
courage, and independence of character. Most of
<span class="pagenum">viii</span>
them were accounted rebels in their day, but the
rebel of one century is often the hero of the next.
Though there may be a strong resemblance in the
aims of these men, their personalities are different.
For instance, there could not be two men more unlike
one another than Voltaire and Tolstoy, yet they
both devoted their energy and their genius to fighting
superstition and shams. Most of our heroes recognized
no authority but that of their own conscience,
and each of them helped in his way the advance of
progress in his country and in the mind of humanity.</p>

<p>The twelve men chosen are not all perhaps the
most famous, or what is commonly called the “greatest,”
that might have been selected. But that is one
of the reasons we have written about them. While
every one knows the story of Galileo, but few may
have read about Tycho Brahe; Luther is a familiar
figure and Savonarola, perhaps, only a name; many
lives have been written of President Lincoln, but
some have never read of William Lloyd Garrison;
Garibaldi is renowned, but Mazzini’s work for Italy
has not often been described.</p>

<p>We have done no more than just mention the political,
scientific, or literary accomplishments of these
men or their philosophy and religious thoughts, because
we have wanted only to tell the story of their
lives. Struggles, difficulties, and dangers which have
to be encountered, ideas, ambitions, and even personal
habits and peculiarities, all make the true story of
<span class="pagenum">ix</span>
a man’s life inspiring and attractive. Ideas are the
mainspring of action. The original thoughts of great
minds and the unflinching resolve of courageous souls
have done far more for the advancement of mankind
than any deeds of physical prowess, violence, or force.
Those of the younger generation to whom will fall
the task of correcting some of the many faults and
errors of their predecessors should remember in their
work that they must rely on the wonderful power of
thought, on knowledge of the lessons of the past, and
on a clear vision of the future.</p>

<p>Maybe some of our readers will find these lives
sufficiently interesting to induce them to read more
of these men in the great books which have been written
about them. If so, we shall feel that we have
succeeded in our object.</p>

<h2>I<br /><br />

SAVONAROLA<br /><br />

1452–1498</h2>

<p><small>Should the whole army of my enemies be arrayed against me, my
heart will not quake: for Thou art my refuge and wilt lead me to
my latter end.</small><br /><br /></p>


<p>Most of us are very easily persuaded to do what
every one else does, because it is so much less trouble.
It is disagreeable to be sneered at or abused. Now
and again we may do something because we know it
to be right at the risk of causing displeasure, but it
is very hard to keep on through a lifetime fighting
against popular opinion or opposing those who are
considered our superiors and whom all the world
look up to as set in authority over us. The orders
of those in command, those who govern, those who
set the fashion, and those who have riches with all
the laws and traditions behind them, are what is
called authority. If you defy authority from stupidity,
obstinacy, or perversity, it is merely foolish; but
if you defy authority because you are convinced that
what you think is right, it is a very difficult thing
to do; and in doing it you are likely to make far more<span class="pagenum">4</span>
enemies than friends. It is much easier to accept
things as they are, to think of your own enjoyment
first and foremost, and let others do the wrangling
while you look on. But the mere spectators in life
are no help to any one, not even to themselves. Life
is conflict. It is to the fighters who, with a clear
vision of better things, have bravely fought the evil
around them that we owe any changes for the better
in the history of the world.</p>

<p>Savonarola, the Italian monk, was by no means a
spectator; he was a fighter of the most strenuous type.
Historians may differ in their accounts of his character
and his work. But one thing is certain: few men
have lived a life of such vigorous activity or one that
was so filled with exciting incidents: few men have
stood by their convictions with such courage and persistence
or suffered more cruelly for their opinions.
He spent the best part of his life fighting authority,
upsetting public opinion, and defying his superiors.
He was defeated in the end because those who were
for the moment stronger than he killed him. But
perhaps his death, as in other cases that may occur
to you, was his greatest triumph. Men may kill the
body of their victim, but they cannot kill the spirit
he has roused by his influence and example. That
lives on when all his persecutors are dead and forgotten.</p>

<p>Girolamo Savonarola was born in Ferrara, a town
in Northern Italy, in the year 1452. He was the<span class="pagenum">5</span>
third of five brothers and he had two sisters. His
grandfather was a physician and a man of learning,
and his father was a courtier of no great importance.
Girolamo was devoted to his mother, and he corresponded
with her all through his eventful life. As a
boy he seems to have been very serious and reserved—one
of those boys whom other boys do not understand.
He did not like playing with other children, but preferred
going out for long rambles by himself. It was
arranged by his family that he should be a doctor,
like his grandfather; but as he grew up and began
to think deeply about everything he saw around him,
he became appalled at the cruelty and wickedness
and frivolity of the society in which he lived, and
his mind was filled with doubts and misgivings.
Poets, players, fools, court flatterers, knights, pages,
scholars, and fair ladies were entertained in the great
red-brick castle of Ferrara, and below in the dark
dungeons lay, confined and chained, prisoners who
had incurred the Duke’s displeasure. It was in the
precincts of this palace that young Girolamo gained
his first experience of life.</p>

<p>When he was nineteen he fell in love with a girl
of the Strozzi family, but he was rejected with disdain
and told he was not sufficiently well born to
aspire to one of such noble birth. This added to the
bitterness of his heart, and his disgust for the world
increased. For two years he struggled with himself,
uncertain whether he should obey his parents or fol<span class="pagenum">6</span>low
his own inclinations; and he prayed daily, “Lord,
teach me the way my soul should walk.” At last, in
despair, he abandoned his medical studies, left home,
and fled secretly to a Dominican monastery at Bologna,
where he became a monk. Villari the historian
describes the touching scene on the very eve of his
departure: “He was sitting with his lute and playing
a sad melody; his mother, as if moved by a spirit
of divination, turned suddenly round to him and exclaimed
mournfully, ‘My son, this is a sign we are
soon to part.’ He roused himself and continued, but
with a trembling hand, to touch the strings of the
lute without raising his eyes from the ground.” The
next day he was gone. He wrote from Bologna to
tell his father of his determination to renounce the
world, where virtue was despised and vice held in
honor. In the convent he began at once to wear himself
to a shadow by acting as a servant and humbling himself
by a life of the severest simplicity and discipline.
In “The Ruin of the World,” a poem he wrote when
he was twenty, he says, “The world is in confusion;
all virtue is extinguished and all good manners. I
find no living light abroad, nor one who blushes for
his vices.”</p>

<p>It was not Savonarola’s young imagination that
made him think the world so very wicked. He was
particularly observant, and noted carefully all that
was passing not only in Ferrara but in the rest of
Italy, and specially in Rome. At that time, indeed,<span class="pagenum">7</span>
while there were many men of learning, great princes,
great artists, and great ladies, the people as a whole
despised religion and led frivolous lives, given up to
every sort of dissipation. Vice, corruption, and robbery
were common both in the Church and outside,
and all classes were degraded by the low tone of
morals.</p>

<p>After six quiet years in the convent, during which
he wrote several poems showing his horror at the immorality
of the world as he saw it, he was sent on a
mission back to Ferrara. But he attracted no attention
there, for “no man is a prophet in his own
country.” Shortly afterwards he was recalled and
sent to the Dominican Convent of San Marco in Florence.
This building is still carefully preserved because
of the beautifully designed frescoes which were
painted on the walls of the refectory, sacristy, and
chapter house, as well as in the cells on the upper
floor, by the artist-monk Fra Angelico, who died in
1455, not many years before Fra Girolamo made San
Marco his headquarters and home.</p>

<p>In appearance, Savonarola was a man of middle
height, with gaunt features, heavy black brows, a
large mouth, heavy jaw, and a protruding underlip.
This may sound unattractive, but features alone do
not make a face. It was his expression by which
those who came in contact with him were fascinated.
His rugged features were beautified by a look of gentle
sympathy and benevolence mixed with firm de<span class="pagenum">8</span>termination,
and his eyes flashed with the fire of a
deep and passionate enthusiasm. The portrait given
here is by Fra Bartolomeo, a friend who came under
the influence of Savonarola and was deeply impressed
by his life and death.</p>

<p>In his great humility he was not at first aware that
he had any special power over other men. While
traveling one day he found himself among a lot of
rough boatmen and soldiers who were indulging in
coarse language and blasphemous oaths. What could
a young monk do in the midst of such a crew? Yet
in half-an-hour Savonarola had eleven of them kneeling
at his feet and imploring forgiveness. Such incidents
as this must have revealed to him the extraordinary
influence he could wield. Curiously enough,
his first sermon in the great Church of San Lorenzo
in Florence was an entire failure. With his awkward
gestures and unimpressive manner he could not
even hold his congregation, which gradually dwindled
away and left the church.</p>

<p>For two years he continued to preach to a few
listless people in the empty aisles of San Gemignano.
All the time, no doubt, he was aware that the power
was growing in him and he was awaiting his opportunity.
Suddenly the moment came, and one day at
Brescia he burst out and became as it were transformed.
Awestruck crowds then flocked to hear him,
and his wonderful oratory and penetrating eloquence
developed quickly, and soon pierced into the very<span class="pagenum">9</span>
souls of his congregations. It often happened that
men climbed walls and swarmed on the pillars to
catch sight of his striking features and hear the deep
tones of his thrilling voice. He practised no tricks
of rhetoric, but his whole being was poured out in a
vehement tempest of eloquence, at one moment melting
his audience to tears, at another freezing them
with terror. The scribe himself who wrote down many
of the sermons breaks off at times with the words,
“Here I was so overcome with weeping that I could
not go on.”</p>

<p>The gift of oratory is a very powerful, but in some
ways a very dangerous gift. The influence of the
written word or the moral example is slow, but far
more likely to be permanent. An orator or preacher
witnesses the immediate effect of his words on his
hearers, yet he often forgets that his influence may
cease the moment his audience withdraws from his
presence. But power such as was possessed by this
strange Italian monk is very rare. Some people were
almost mesmerized, and stories of supernatural events
began to be told about him: a halo of light was seen
round his head, and his face was said to shine so as
to illuminate the whole church. In addition to his
gifts as a passionate preacher, Savonarola’s pen was
a considerable help to him, and he published a collection
of his writings. “The Triumph of the Cross”
was his principal work; but all he wrote was inspired
by extreme piety and by his ardent desire to bring<span class="pagenum">10</span>
mankind nearer to God. He also showed wisdom and
judgment in council in solving difficult theological
problems.</p>

<p>Pico di Mirandola, a great scholar and a nobleman,
was so much struck by his extraordinary qualities
that he urged Lorenzo de Medici, who was at the
time Lord of Florence, to invite him to come and stay
in the Tuscan capital; this accordingly was done. But
no one suspected that the humble monk who trudged
on foot through the gateway of the city was one day
to be the practical ruler of Florence. He was in his
thirty-ninth year when he was elected Prior of San
Marco.</p>

<p>Lorenzo, known as the Magnificent, was perhaps
the most eminent of the Medici family, who for some
years were practically rulers of Florence. Although
he had a council who nominally conducted the affairs
of State, he generally managed to have it filled by
men who were favorable to his policy and his aims,
and so he gradually became complete master of the
city. He was cruel, unscrupulous, and ambitious, and
under his rule the people were deprived of much of
their liberty. But as an Italian historian says, “If
Florence was to have a tyrant she could never have
found a better or a more pleasant one.” While on
the one hand he was oppressing the people and persecuting
those whom he suspected to be his enemies, on
the other hand he encouraged festivities and reveling,
song and dance, and general merriment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">11</span></p>

<p>In the previous century a very great change had
come over Europe. The period is known as the
Renaissance, which means re-birth. The darkness of
the Middle Ages had passed, and there was a great
revival of learning, a reawakening of art and science,
and new ideas about religion and philosophy began
to be discussed. The art of printing, which had only
lately been invented, made it possible for copies of
the works of the great classical authors to be distributed
and widely read, and in Italy some of the
most eminent writers, painters, and sculptors had
come to the front. Greek was taught at the universities,
and professors traveled about lecturing to
crowded classes on the great masterpieces of Greek
literature and philosophy, which till then had been
left neglected and forgotten. In the sixteenth century,
therefore, the influence and results of the movement
were very apparent.</p>

<p>By his wealth, by his splendor, and by his patronage
of art and literature, Lorenzo de Medici did much
to make Florence the center of the civilized world.
He himself was the leading spirit among artists and
men of letters who assembled around him. He spoke
fluently about poetry, music, sculpture, and philosophy,
and actually used to sing his own carnival songs
in the streets to an admiring throng.</p>

<p>It was to this brilliant and powerful man, who was
the chief authority in the State, that Savonarola from
the first refused to show any respect whatsoever. He<span class="pagenum">12</span>
declared that his election as Prior was due to God,
not to Lorenzo. He saw, moreover, that while Lorenzo
was interested in art and learning, the people of
Florence were badly governed and had no freedom or
independence. Although the very Convent of San
Marco, of which he was the head, had been enriched
by the bounty of Lorenzo, the Prior declined to do
homage to him, or even to visit him, and whenever
Lorenzo walked in the gardens of the monastery he
carefully avoided him, saying that his intercourse was
with God, not with man. Lorenzo, however, was anxious
to add this remarkable monk to the select society
he had gathered about him, and to have him join
the interesting discussions on art, letters, and philosophy
which took place at his banquets and assemblies.
But Savonarola regarded him as an enemy
of the people and of true religion; and even when
Lorenzo came to Mass at San Marco he paid no attention
to him, and though he found a number of gold
coins in the alms-chest, obviously the gift of Lorenzo,
he would not take the money for the convent,
but sent it away to be distributed among the poor.
Savonarola did not believe in the Church being rich
except in the spiritual sense; in fact, the greed of
the Church for actual riches was what he constantly
denounced.</p>

<p>Within the year, however, the Prince and the priest
were destined to meet, for Lorenzo on his deathbed
sent for the Prior of San Marco. One account tells<span class="pagenum">13</span>
how Savonarola came and, standing by the bedside,
bade Lorenzo repent of his sins and give up his wealth,
but refused him absolution because the dying man
hesitated to restore their liberties to the people of
Florence. While some thought that the wise and
great prince was very prudent and lenient with the
impossible, fanatical monk, others were inclined to
suspect that he was more probably afraid of him.</p>

<p>Lorenzo’s son, Piero de Medici, succeeded his father,
but he was too weak and incompetent a man to count,
and Savonarola, who continued with increasing vehemence
to denounce the guilt and corruption of mankind,
strengthened his own influence and control over
the people. Piero became alarmed and had him removed
from Florence, so that for a time he was
obliged to preach outside at Prato and Bologna. But
soon he returned, journeying on foot over the Apennines,
and he was welcomed back with rapture at San
Marco. He at once set about reforming the convent,
he opened schools, and he continued to preach and
to prophesy. He began to see visions and to hear
mysterious voices, hallucinations not unnatural to a
man in a state of such intense spiritual exaltation or
mental excitement. He was a believer in dreams and
revelations, and the trances which followed his fasts
were the cause of many of his prophetic utterances.
At the same time he perceived with astonishing foresight
the inevitable course of national events. He
foretold the coming of “the Sword of God,” which<span class="pagenum">14</span>
he declared he saw bent toward the earth while the
sky darkened, thunder pealed, lightning flashed, and
the whole world was devastated by famine, bloodshed,
and pestilence. Thus would the sons of guilty
Italy be swept down and vanquished. Shortly afterwards,
it so happened that Charles VIII, King of
France, brought an army across the Alps, descended
into Italy, and advanced on Florence.</p>

<p>This brought on a crisis in the city. The panic-stricken
Piero de Medici, uncertain how to act, went
out at last himself to meet the French King, fell
prostrate before him, and accepted at once the hard
terms he laid down. His cowardice was the signal
for Florence to rise up in fury. Piero was deposed,
and other ambassadors, of whom Savonarola was one,
were commissioned to confer with Charles. The King
was much impressed by the Dominican preacher, but
nevertheless he entered the city and imperiously demanded
the restoration of the Medici as rulers. The
Florentines boldly refused. “What,” asked Charles,
“if I sound my trumpets?” “Then,” answered Gino
Capponi, one of the magistrates, “Florence must toll
her bells.” The idea of a general insurrection startled
the King, and after a further conference with Savonarola
he left the city.</p>

<p>The Medici had fallen for the moment, Charles
VIII had withdrawn, Florence was now free. It was
not to the Medici family, to their magistrates, or to
their nobles that the people turned in their good for<span class="pagenum">15</span>tune,
but to the Prior of San Marco, who, they considered,
was chiefly responsible for the favorable turn
events had taken. After seventy years of subjection
to the Medici the people had forgotten the art of self-government.
Partly in gratitude, partly in confidence,
and partly in awe, they chose Savonarola as
their ruler, and he became the lawgiver of Florence.
He began by exercising his power with discretion and
justice. His first thought was for the poor, for whom
collections were made. He proposed also to give more
employment to the needy and lighten the taxation
that weighed too heavily upon them. His whole
scheme was inspired by his deep religious feeling.
“Fear God,” was his first command to the people
whom he summoned to meet him in the Cathedral.
Then he exhorted them to prefer the republic to their
own selfish interests. He promised a general amnesty
to political offenders and the establishment of a General
Council. He had studied the principles of government
and desired to set up a democratic system,
that is to say, to give the people the responsibility
of governing themselves instead of submitting to the
aristocratic rule of a prince and his nobles. With
all his enthusiasm and apparent fanaticism, he showed
himself in many ways to be a practical man of affairs.
His preaching continued to be his chief method
of exercising his influence. The maintenance of the
constitution, he told the people, depended on God’s
blessing: its head was Jesus Christ Himself. His aim<span class="pagenum">16</span>
was to establish there and then practical Christianity
such as Christ taught, so that Florence might become
the model city of the world. Men may scoff
and say this was the impossible dream of a madman.
But it is better to aim too high and fail than to accept,
as many people do, a low standard because it
is too difficult and too much trouble to fight against
a vicious public opinion.</p>

<p>The immediate effect of Savonarola’s teaching was
that the citizens of Florence began suddenly to lead
lives of strict simplicity, renouncing frivolity, feasting,
and gambling, and even dressing with austere
plainness, discarding their jewels and ornaments. The
carnival of 1497 was celebrated by “a bonfire of the
vanities” in the great square of the town. Priceless
manuscripts and precious folios were hurled from
the windows into the street and collected in carts
with other articles by troops of boys dressed in white.
A huge pyramid twenty feet high was erected in the
Piazza. At the bottom of it were stacked masks and
dresses and wigs; on the step above, mirrors, puffs,
curling-tongs, hair-pins, powder and paint. Still
higher were lutes, mandolines, cards, chessmen, balls,
dice; then came drawings and priceless pictures and
statues in wood and colored wax of gods and heroes.
Towering higher than anything else, on the top a figure
of Satan was enthroned, a monstrous puppet,
filled with gunpowder and sulphur, with goat’s legs
and a hairy skin. At nightfall a great procession<span class="pagenum">17</span>
accompanied Savonarola to the spot. Four monks
with torches set fire to the pyramid, and as it crackled
and blazed the people danced and yelled and screamed
round it, while drums and trumpets sounded and bells
pealed from the church towers. This was the very
crude method by which Savonarola sought to abolish
the luxury and the vanity which he considered were
degrading the lives of the people.</p>

<p>While Savonarola was at the height of his power
and fame, filling the cathedral with dense crowds who
flocked to hear him, his enemies were already engaged
in plotting his downfall. He had succeeded in destroying
the authority of the Medici in Florence itself,
but there was another and a stronger authority
outside with whom he had still to reckon, and this
was the Pope.</p>

<p>It is difficult to believe now, when a venerable and
respected ecclesiastic, living in quiet retirement at
Rome, represents the head of the Roman Catholic
Church, that at the end of the fifteenth century a
series of men held that office who were Italian princes,
many of whom had for their chief purpose the enrichment
of themselves and their families by means
of treachery and violence. It happened that the very
worst of these, a member of the Borgia family, whose
infamous career of crime is notorious in history, was
Pope at this time under the name of Alexander VI.
A conflict was inevitable between this unscrupulous
prince and the high-minded priest who desired to<span class="pagenum">18</span>
free the Church from the corrupt state which money,
intrigue, and worldliness had brought it.</p>

<p>Alexander VI tried first by bribery to silence the
daring preacher. He offered him the red hat of a
cardinal, but Savonarola replied, “No hat will I have
but that of a martyr reddened with my own blood.”
The Pope was joined by the Duke of Milan in attempting
to deprive the Prior of his power. He invited
Savonarola to Rome, at first courteously, but when
a refusal came he repeated his commands peremptorily
and at last accompanied by threats, but still Savonarola
refused to obey. As he continued to preach
both in Florence and in other towns, Alexander became
alarmed lest the strength of his voice might
shake even the power of Rome. An unsuccessful attempt
was made on his life. The citizens of Florence
were already beginning to grow weary of the austere
regulations imposed upon them. The city became
sharply divided into two political factions. The supporters
of Savonarola are called the Piagnoni, his enemies
the Arrabbiati. Even the children joined in and
greeted each other with showers of pebbles. One day
the Prior was insulted in the cathedral, where an ass’s
skin was spread over the cushion of the pulpit and
sharp nails were fixed in the board on which he would
strike his hand.</p>

<p>Then at last, with great ceremonial, an order from
the Pope was read excommunicating him, that is to
say, expelling him from the Church. But still Savon<span class="pagenum">19</span>arola
took no notice whatever, declaring that a man
so laden with crime and infamy as Alexander was no
true Pope. He continued to preach and even to celebrate
Mass in the cathedral. At the next carnival,
amidst extraordinary excitement and reveling, he ordered
a second bonfire of vanities, in which many
costly objects were again destroyed. His sermons contained
hostile references to the Pope, whose life and
career were openly described, and he went so far as
to address letters to the great sovereigns of Europe,
including Henry VII of England, bidding them call
a council to depose Alexander VI. One of these letters
was intercepted and sent to Rome by the Duke
of Milan.</p>

<p>After a brief period of comparative quiet, during
which Florence was visited by the plague, a conspiracy
for the restoration of the Medici was discovered.
Five leading citizens were found to be mixed up in the
plot, one of them a much respected old man called
Bernardo del Nero. All five were seized and put to
death. It was said that had Savonarola raised his
voice he might anyhow have obtained mercy for Bernardo.
But he remained silent, and so increased the
number of his enemies and the exasperation of Pope
Alexander.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in the city itself another dispute arose.
A bitter feud had long existed between the Order of
the Franciscan monks and the Order of the Dominicans.
The Franciscans having heard that Savonarola<span class="pagenum">20</span>
would go through fire to prove the truth of his prophetic
gifts, he was challenged from the pulpit of
Santa Croce to put his miraculous powers to the test.
He dismissed the proposal with contempt, but one of
his over-zealous followers accepted, and a trial by
fire was arranged. Savonarola no doubt saw the folly
of the whole proceeding. He dared not refuse, but
he hesitated, and was accused of showing cowardice.
On April 7, 1498, two piles were erected in the Piazza.
They were forty yards long and five feet high, and
composed of faggots and broom that would easily
blaze up. The stacks were separated by a narrow
path of two feet, down which the two priests were
to pass. Every window was full; even the roofs were
packed; and it seemed as if the whole population of
the city had crowded to the spot. The two factions
were assembled in an arcade called the Loggia dei
Lanzi. Disputes arose between them. The Dominicans
insisted that their champion should carry the
Host with him into the flames. This the Franciscans
declared was sacrilege. The mob, who had come to
witness the barbarous spectacle, some of them hoping
to see a miracle, were impatient and disappointed,
and when, after hours of waiting, a shower of rain
came and finally put an end to the farce, they became
infuriated.</p>

<p>You may think that people were very superstitious
in those days, to believe that men could walk through
fire or that a man could prophesy and that his face<span class="pagenum">21</span>
could shine with light. They were indeed very superstitious,
especially about religious happenings. But
I rather think many people still suffer from this weakness,
although it may be in a different way. Superstition
is the sign of a shallow and uneducated mind,
or a mind that is unbalanced, and it will be a long
time before there are no people of that sort in the
world. It is not surprising, therefore, that these Florentines
should have been aroused to fury by this
ridiculous business. They probably thought they were
being made fools of, and were ashamed, too, that they
had taken the whole thing seriously. Anyhow, some
one had to pay.</p>

<p>Savonarola and his followers hurried back to their
convent and only just managed to escape. Although
from the pulpit of the church the Prior attempted to
give his explanation of the events, it was clear that
from that moment his power was at an end. The
fickle Florentines, ready for the next sensation and
prepared to submit with light-hearted indifference to
whatever faction was the most powerful at the moment,
drew away from their prophet and lawgiver
and deserted him. His enemies had gained the upper
hand, and the Council, completely hostile to him,
eventually decreed his banishment.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the mob collected outside St. Mark’s.
They threw a volley of stones at the windows of the
church, which was filled with people. There was a
panic. The convent gates were closed and barred.<span class="pagenum">22</span>
Some of the monks had secretly brought in arms,
helmets, halberts, crossbows, and a barrel of gunpowder.</p>

<p>Savonarola strongly disapproved of this, and as
he passed through the cloisters with the Sacrament
he bade them lay down their arms. Some of them
obeyed him. By the evening the mob had set fire to
the doors. They succeeded in scaling the walls and
getting into the cloisters and chapel. Here Savonarola
was found praying before the altar, and one
of his friends, Fra Domenico, stood by him armed
with an enormous candlestick to guard him from the
blows of his assailants. In the midst of the turmoil
and confusion, a traitorous monk declared that the
shepherd should lay down his life for his flock. Immediately
Savonarola gave himself up to the armed
party which had been sent to arrest him. His two
most faithful friends, Fra Domenico and Fra Silvestro,
accompanied him. As he went he called out:
“My brethren, remember never to doubt. The work
of the Lord is ever progressive, and my death will only
hasten it.”</p>

<p>As he came out into the street the mob greeted him
with a shout of ferocious joy. It was night, and the
faces of the threatening, yelling men in the torchlight
must indeed have been terrifying. So great was their
fury that the guards could with difficulty protect him
as they led him and his companions to the great palace<span class="pagenum">23</span>
known as the Palazzo Vecchio, where they were cast
into a dungeon.</p>

<p>The account of Savonarola’s torture is most tragic
and terrible. He found that he simply could not bear
the agony. While his limbs were stretched and
twisted on the rack his courage and his senses forsook
him, and he acknowledged himself guilty of any crime
laid to his charge. The torture lasted for three days,
and in the intervals he withdrew all he had said. “My
God,” he cried, “I denied Thee for fear of pain.”
Finally his judges, who were drawn from his bitterest
enemies, condemned him to death. The Pope Alexander,
who on hearing the news praised his well-beloved
Florentines as true sons of the Church, wanted
his enemy to be brought to Rome that he might see
him suffer death before him. But the Arrabbiati were
determined that his end should come in Florence itself.
His two fellow-monks received the same treatment
as he did. Fra Domenico showed great courage,
and under the most cruel torture no syllable could
be extracted from him which could hurt his master.
Fra Silvestro, on the other hand, collapsed at the very
sight of the rack, and acquiesced in every accusation
brought against his master or himself.</p>

<p>On his last night in this world, though worn with
weakness and racked by torture, nevertheless Savonarola
slept a peaceful sleep with his two companions,
and spoke a few touching words imploring the pardon<span class="pagenum">24</span>
of God for any sins he might have committed. The
scaffold was erected on the Piazza and connected with
the magistrates’ platform by a wooden bridge. As
the three unfortunate Dominicans stepped over the
planks, cruel boys thrust pointed sticks through the
crevices to prick their bare feet. The first ceremony
was to degrade them and deprive them of their robes.
This was done by the papal nuncio. Then Savonarola,
after witnessing the fate of his two friends, was
taken himself and placed on the center beam of the
huge cross, from the arms of which his disciples’
bodies were already dangling. A shudder of horror
seemed to seize the multitude, and a voice was heard
calling out, “Prophet, now is the time to perform a
miracle.” There was a silence as he neared the place.
He stood for a moment looking down on the crowd
and his followers expected him to speak. But he said
no word. The halter was fastened round his neck,
light was set to the faggots, and in a few moments
the great preacher, the lawgiver of Florence, was
burned alive, amidst jests and taunts and curses,
on the very spot where shortly before the vanities
had blazed. The last words that passed his lips as
the flames reached him were: “The Lord suffered
as much for me.” His ashes were cast into the river
Arno so that no trace of him might remain. Not
many years after, with curious inconsistency, the
Church wanted to canonize—that is, to make a saint<span class="pagenum">25</span>
of the man whom she had burned. This, however, was
never done.</p>

<p>If we trust some of the accounts handed down to
us, Savonarola can be accused of having shown weakness
in the face of torture; he can be accused of having
been too ambitious for political power and of
having, in the fear of losing his authority, allowed
without protest the execution of innocent men who
were charged with conspiracy; he can be accused of
having traded on the reputation of being a prophet
who saw visions and to whom miraculous events occurred.
He certainly placed too much confidence in
the permanent effect of his eloquent preaching, and
deluded himself in trusting in the loyalty of the people
whom he had apparently moved. He may, no
doubt, be called a fanatic—that is to say, a wild, odd
man, who disregards every one and everything in his
zeal to pursue the object he has in view. Such people
are not frightened of making fools of themselves,
and their peculiarities and their strange behavior can
be very easily ridiculed. But apart from the contradictory
accounts, and the incomplete records of
history, we have Savonarola’s actual sermons and writings,
without which he might indeed have been condemned
as a charlatan. In them we can read in his
own stirring language of his noble intentions and
lofty aspirations, of his vigorous and single-minded
pursuit of what he believed to be right, and of his un<span class="pagenum">26</span>compromising
hatred of worldliness, wickedness, and
crime. He was not immediately connected with the
great movement known as the Reformation, in which
Luther a few years later was the principal figure, when
the Protestants broke off from the Roman Catholic
Church. But Luther declared Savonarola to have been
the precursor of his doctrine. And, indeed, his strong
protest against the immorality and corruption of the
Papacy and his fervent desire to increase the spiritual
rather than the material authority of the Church—that
is to say, its influence over men’s minds rather
than its worldly power—helped to lay the foundations
on which the great Reformers built. At the same time
it must not be supposed that he himself had any desire
to alter the creeds and traditions of the Roman
Church.</p>

<p>A very fine description of Savonarola is introduced
by one of our great novelists, George Eliot, in the story
of “Romola.” Referring to his martyrdom, she says:</p>



<p class="small">Power rose against him not because of his sins but because
of his greatness, not because he sought to deceive
the world but because he sought to make it noble. And
through that greatness of his he endured double agony:
not only the reviling and the torture and the death-throe,
but the agony of sinking from the vision of glorious
achievement into that deep shadow where he could only
say, “I count as nothing: darkness encompasses me:
yet the light I saw was the true light.”</p>

<h2>II<br />

WILLIAM THE SILENT<br />

1533–1584</h2>

<p class="center"><small>
Je maintiendrai</small></p>


<p><span class="smcap">William of Orange of Nassau</span>, or William the
Silent as he is known, was an extraordinarily interesting
man, if only from the fact that everything
about him, from his titles and his circumstances to
his character, was a contradiction. For one thing,
the name “Silent” gives quite a wrong impression
of him. It sounds as though he might have been
taciturn, shy, or difficult to get on with, but he happened
to be particularly easy and sympathetic, delightful
as a companion, and eloquent in speech. How
this misnomer came about will be related later.</p>

<p>William of Orange took his title from the smallest
of his lands, a tiny province in France, near Avignon,
of which he was the sovereign prince. He was
a German count and a Flemish magnate; a Lutheran
by birth, he was educated as a Catholic, but died
a Calvinist. His character was just as varied and
full of contrasts as his circumstances, so he interests<span class="pagenum">28</span>
and appeals to a great number of people, and we
are agreed that he is one of the most lovable and
heroic characters in history.</p>

<p>William was born in 1533 in the German castle
of Dillenburg, the eldest of twelve children. His
mother, Juliana of Stolberg, was a woman of great
character—a wise woman and religious in the truest
sense of the word. To the end of her life she was
the adviser of her sons and a support and comfort
to her many children. Several of them inherited her
character, and principally William of Orange himself,
and another, Louis. William’s father, also called
William, was a good man who had gone through hard
times, and who had finally, slowly but surely embraced
the Protestant religion. He appears to us to
be rather a washed-out edition of his remarkable son.</p>

<p>Orange spent the first eleven years of his life at
Dillenburg. The great fortress rose from a rocky
bend of a river, with towers and battlements and gateways
such as one sees in mediæval pictures, and could
hold a thousand people. Here all his mother’s children
were born, and she managed her huge household
in such a way as to become quite celebrated as
the best mother and housewife in the country.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a id="p28" name="p28">
<img src="images/i_fp028.jpg" width="500" height="623" alt="WILLIAM THE SILENT" /></a>
<div class="caption">WILLIAM THE SILENT</div>
</div>

<p>When William was eleven years old he inherited,
through the death of a cousin, great lands in the
Netherlands, and the little province of Orange. Thus
he became, in spite of his tender years, a very important
person, and through the wish of the Emperor
<span class="pagenum">29</span>Charles V, King of Spain and the Netherlands, who
had a great regard for the Nassau family, he was
sent to Brussels to be educated as a Catholic. Also
at the Emperor’s request he became a page at his
court, and by the time he was fifteen the Emperor
had made an intimate friend of him, taking him into
his complete confidence, and allowing him to be present
at the gravest and most secret conclaves. He
would ask William’s advice about important matters
of State and go by his judgments. This might have
been enough to turn the head of any one more than
double the boy’s age, but it did not appear to spoil
William. He seemed only to profit and to put to the
best possible use all the knowledge he got of human
nature and of public affairs by being, so to speak,
behind the scenes in this very confidential and important
position. Charles, who took pride in discovering
great men, showed in the case of Orange a great deal
of insight into character.</p>

<p>When he was eighteen the Emperor gave him a
wife, a young girl of noble family, Anne of Egmont.
She lived six years and they had two children. Judging
by Orange’s letters to his wife he must have been
a faithful and loving husband, but he could not have
seen much of her, as he was nearly always away from
home fighting for his master. Charles had made him,
at the age of twenty-one, General-in-Chief of his army
on the frontier of France, with which country Charles
was at war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">30</span></p>

<p>It was on young William’s shoulder that the Emperor
leant on the celebrated occasion of his abdication,
when, worn out with illness, old before his time—for
he was only fifty-five—sick of life and of his own
schemes and wars, he gave up his crown and titles to
his son, Philip, himself retiring into a monastery in
the depths of Spain.</p>

<p>The superstition was still held at that period of
history (and, in fact, up to more recent days) that
a king is a king by divine right, and that he can
therefore do no wrong. Charles’s record in crime
is no mean one, though it does not perhaps equal that
of his son Philip II. He was a despot, and a cruel
despot, though he liked to regard himself, as many
kings have before and since him, as merely fatherly.
But he had behind his actions some sort of principle,
while his son appeared to have none whatever.
Charles had never let the system of Inquisition die
down in the Netherlands, and on his accession he had
immediately made efforts to bring the people to submission,
visiting one of its principal towns with an
army and taking away by force all its privileges, and
imposing heavy fines upon its inhabitants. He passed
edicts against the Protestantism of Luther, “to exterminate
the root and ground of this pest,” and it
is said burnt in his lifetime at the least fifty thousand
people. How Charles could have been of service to
the Netherlands it is difficult to see, for he only committed
crimes against the people, crushing their in<span class="pagenum">31</span>dependence
wherever he could, and using their great
industry as revenue for his endless wars in other parts
of the world. Yet, as some of his admiring biographers
tell us, no man could have gone to church more
regularly. He attended Mass constantly, and listened
to a sermon every Sunday.</p>

<p>On this occasion of giving up his crown he stood
before the people of the Netherlands, in the great hall
of his palace at Brussels, clothed in black Imperial
robes, with a pale face and tears streaming down
his cheeks. He had a great sense of dramatic effect,
and it was an impressive spectacle. He had persuaded
himself that he had nothing on his conscience,
and by so doing he persuaded his subjects too. He told
them in a choking voice that he had been nothing
but a benefactor, and that he had acted as he had
done only for their good and because he cared for
them. He told them how he regretted leaving the
Netherlands and his reasons for going. A greater
contrast could hardly be imagined than this worn-out
man and the young and noble-looking being on whose
shoulder he leant. But the Emperor, with a real
regard for Orange, which was a bright spot in his
character, passed him on with words of advice to
Philip: for, believing as he did in young William’s
great powers of statesmanship, he wished that his own
son might defer to him and regard him as an adviser
in time to come.</p>

<p>Philip at once set Orange to bring about peace<span class="pagenum">32</span>
between Spain and France, and this he accomplished
with brilliant success, securing excellent terms for his
master. Philip saw how great were Orange’s persuasive
powers as a diplomatist, and realized how
valuable he could be in his schemes.</p>

<p>Philip II was twenty-eight when he became king.
He had not the pleasant manner of his father, and
he was not nearly so cultivated or so diplomatic. Unlike
Charles, he knew no language but Spanish. He
was a small and wretched-looking creature in appearance,
with thin legs and a narrow chest. His lower
jaw protruded most horribly, and he had a heavy
hanging lip and enormous mouth, inherited from his
father. He was fair, with a yellow beard, and had
a habit of always looking on the ground when he
spoke, as if he had some crime to hide or as though
he were suffering. This, it is said, came from pains
in his stomach, the result of too great a love of pastry.
It had been thought politic that he should marry
Mary Tudor of England; and when Philip became
king she had been his wife two years. They ought
certainly to have been very happy together, having
the same tastes—a hatred of Protestants and a delight
in burning and massacring—but in spite of this they
did not get on. Mary was older than Philip and
very unattractive, so he neglected her completely and
left her to herself in England, where she shortly
afterwards died.</p>

<p>Philip’s ambition on his accession was to make<span class="pagenum">33</span>
peace with Europe in order to be able to devote himself
to putting down what he called heresy. Orange
was meanwhile chosen as a hostage by the King of
France while the treaty between the two countries
was being completed, and it was during his stay in
France that Orange made the discovery which was
to influence his whole life.</p>

<p>While he was hunting one day with the King of
France (Henry II) in the Forest of Vincennes, he
found himself alone with the King, who at once began
to talk of all his plans and schemes, of which he was
full to overflowing. The gist of the matter was a
plot just formed between himself and the other Catholic
sovereigns to put a final end to Protestantism or
heresy. They had, Henry confided to Orange, solemnly
bound themselves to kill all the converts to the
New Religion in France and the Netherlands, and
the Duke of Alva—a Spaniard and fellow-hostage of
Orange—was to carry out their schemes. The King
described exactly how they would set about ridding
the world of “that accursed vermin,” how they were
to be discovered and how massacred. In his excitement
and enthusiasm the French King never observed
how Orange was taking it. He believed him to be
party to the whole arrangement. He failed to notice
that Orange never opened his lips or spoke a word—for
though absolutely horrified, the Prince managed
to control his expression and to remain silent—and
thus he earned his well-known but misleading title.<span class="pagenum">34</span>
But Orange, hearing all this, made up his mind. His
purpose was fixed, and as soon as possible he got permission
to visit the Netherlands, where he was determined
to persuade the people to show opposition to
the presence of the Spanish troops and to get them
out of the country. They were put there by Philip
for the one and only purpose of crushing independence
and stamping on Protestantism. Orange found
that an Inquisition had been decided upon, more terrible
than anything that had gone before.</p>

<p>We have seen that already under Philip’s father
the Netherlands had been treated with great cruelty,
and the Papal Inquisition had been used to put a
stop to Lutheranism. The spirit of the great Reformer
had taken a firm hold in this country, and
Luther’s work, combined with the work of Calvin
in France, had made the country keenly Protestant
and determined to resist any sort of Catholic domination.
The Netherlands character itself was marked
by one great quality which, in the words of the historian
Motley, was “the love of liberty and the instinct
of self-government.” The country was composed
of brave and hardy races who for centuries
had been fighting for their liberty against great odds.
Divided as their country was into provinces, they
had had no king of their own, but had been governed
by feudal lords and treated as slaves and dependents,
with no power or voice in their own government.
From this wretched position they emerged by their<span class="pagenum">35</span>
own efforts. By their great industry and character
they made themselves rich and powerful, and, forming
themselves in the cities into trade guilds and
leagues, they fought against, and in many cases turned
out, the feudal lords, governing themselves by their
own laws and choosing their own governors from
among themselves. Seeing their great wealth and
prosperity, neighboring countries were desirous of
adding these riches to their own territories, and thus,
through war and purchase, the Netherlands fell under
the dominion of Burgundy with its powerful reigning
dukes, and under Austria through further wars, and
finally, by a marriage of a Prince of Burgundy with
a Princess of Spain, they became subjects of the latter
country.</p>

<p>Charles V was the first King of Spain and the
Netherlands, and with his rule the worst of their trials
began. Under the Burgundian dukes the people of
the Netherlands had managed to retain self-government,
firmly clinging to their liberties, and at no price
would they consent to become a province of Spain.
No two peoples could have been more opposite in
character—Spain quite behind the age, bigoted, superstitious,
violently Catholic, cruel and aristocratic;
and the Netherlands, full of life and activity, the
rival of Italy in art and learning, ready to go ahead
and adopt all the advanced and enlightened thought
of the Reformation. In trade they had no rivals, for
they were the busiest manufacturers in the world.<span class="pagenum">36</span>
Their stuffs were celebrated everywhere, and their
ships visited all the ports in the world. This happy,
brave little people were to be crushed and persecuted
for their valor. But they were to find a deliverer—a
leader who was to be the source of their inspiration
and courage in the awful days to come—one who was
willing, though he could gain nothing by it, to throw
in his lot with theirs, to suffer and endure the same
as they.</p>

<p>Orange had not much sympathy with the Reformers.
He was an aristocrat and a Catholic, and had
never thought of being anything but completely loyal
to kings—after all he was one of them: he had what
is considered the privilege of addressing crowned
heads as “cousin.” But his sense of justice was one
of the strongest things in his character, and he was
quite determined to protect the harmless multitudes
in the Netherlands from the horrible punishments and
deaths which were in store for them, and these people
were all his inferiors by birth—what are termed
“the masses.” Dyers, tanners, and trades-people were
the only Protestants in those days, so it was a more
tremendous thing than one thinks for an aristocrat
to take up the cause of the people as Orange was
about to do. It is generally some remarkable man
among the people who fights for justice for his own
class, and it was, as I have said, the more wonderful
for William to have taken up the cause of the people
as his sympathy did not come from his agreement<span class="pagenum">37</span>
with them on religion, but purely from his manly,
just, and generous disposition.</p>

<p>At this time in his twenty-seventh year, William
was very rich, prosperous, and powerful. Few perhaps
realized that there lay within him the seeds of
future greatness. But though he had a thoughtful
and an intellectual nature, he also had a pleasure-loving,
easygoing nature, and nothing could exceed
the luxury and magnificence of the life he led in his
great palace at Brussels. It was a life full of color,
variety, and amusement, with masquerades, banquets,
chases, and tourneys from morning till night.
Twenty-four noblemen and eighteen pages of gentle
birth served in his household. One day, in order to
economize, Orange dismissed twenty-eight cooks!
Princely houses in Germany sent their cooks to learn
in his kitchen, so celebrated was the excellence of
his dishes. He kept, as princes and noblemen did
in those days, open house, but he did not keep his
money. A contemporary historian—a Catholic and
an opponent—describes him at this time:</p>



<p class="small">Never did arrogant or indiscreet word issue from his
mouth under the impulse of anger or other passion. If
any of his servants committed a fault, he was satisfied
to admonish them gently, without resorting to menace or
to abusive language. He was master of a sweet and winning
power of persuasion, by means of which he gave
form to the great ideas within him, and thus he succeeded
in bending to his will the other lords about the court as he
chose, beloved and in high favour above all men with the
<span class="pagenum">38</span>
people by reason of a gracious manner that he had of
saluting and addressing in a fascinating and familiar
way all whom he met.</p>

<p>Orange had become a widower at twenty-five, but
two years later he married again; his bride was Anne
of Saxony, the daughter of a great German Lutheran
magnate. The marriage met with great opposition
from the Catholics, and this seemed to make Orange
only more determined. There was nothing to recommend
Anne except her wealth and lands. She was
lame and had no charm, and became later an odious
and impossible woman who made her husband very
unhappy.</p>

<p>King Philip meanwhile continued to shower honors
upon Orange. He made him a Councilor of State
and Stadtholder or Governor of Holland, Zeeland,
and Utrecht, and head of the troops in those provinces.
If Orange had been content to do as he was
told, his prosperous, pleasant life might have continued.
Fortune from his birth had smiled upon him,
and everything that the heart of man could desire
seemed to lie within the hollow of his hand. But
at the risk of losing everything—his high honors and
worldly position—he was to speak and to act as his
heart and conscience told him to, which was in direct
opposition to the King and to his own material welfare.
From this time onwards Orange, in a quiet,
determined way, resisted Philip and his commands.
His resistance was so far guarded, as he could not as<span class="pagenum">39</span>
yet defy him openly. His first step by way of protecting
the Netherlanders was to use his position to
persuade some powerful members of the States General
(a form of Parliament,) to refuse supplies unless
the Spanish troops were removed. Philip had given
Orange the names of “several excellent persons” suspected
of the New Religion and commanded Orange
to put them to death. Orange not only did not do
this, but gave them warning so that they might escape.
Philip now issued an edict that no one should
read or copy any of the writings of Luther or Calvin,
or discuss any doubtful matters in the Scriptures, or
break images, on pain of death by fire, or by being
beheaded or buried alive if a woman. The troops
were to be there to enforce the edicts. He made more
bishoprics in the Netherlands in order that the ruffian
bishops might spy and pry and assist in finding
heretics. The principal ruffian was one Granvelle,
on whom the Pope conferred the title of cardinal.</p>

<p>Philip himself left the Netherlands for Spain, and
made his half-sister, Margaret of Parma, Regent.
She was thirty-seven and an ardent Catholic. Her
recommendation to Philip was that she felt greater
horror for heretics than for any other form of evil-doer.
She was not particularly clever, but she had
learnt to dissimulate—in other words, to tell stories—and
never to give a direct answer to a question. She
looked mannish, having a mustache, and she suffered
from gout. This gave the impression that she<span class="pagenum">40</span>
was masterful and like a man, which she was not
at all.</p>

<p>It was not long before Philip discovered that Orange
was not seeing eye to eye with him. He found
out that, as commander of the Spanish troops, he was
using his position to check persecution. Philip therefore
ceased to admit him and Count Egmont, another
suspect, to the inner councils. But he was not willing
to get rid of Orange or to drive him into rebellion.
He knew his power, and the service he could
still render, and he realized the great anger it would
cause in the Netherlands were William to be dismissed.
When the persecution under Granvelle and
the enormities committed by the Spanish troops on
innocent people became too much for Orange to bear
without open protest, Philip, fearing a general revolt,
undertook to do what Orange asked him. He dismissed
the troops temporarily, and the Cardinal retired
into Spain to hatch more horrible plots, especially
against Orange, whom he hated more than any
one in the world. Orange had threatened to resign
if he remained. In doing this he was not in a temper;
that was not his way, for he scarcely ever lost
his head. When he addressed himself to Philip with
these requests, he faced the consequences. He knew
that he would almost certainly incur the everlasting
anger of the King.</p>

<p>The country having a moment’s respite from Granvelle,
Orange now set himself to obtain three things:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">41</span></p>

<p>1. A regular meeting of the States General (or
Parliament).</p>

<p>2. The organization of a real, single, and efficient
Council of State that should be the supreme source
of government.</p>

<p>3. A relaxation of the persecution of heresy.</p>

<p>He worked ceaselessly amongst the nobles trying
to get their powerful aid on the side of the people
and the Protestant Revolution, persuading Count Egmont,
one of the foremost and most powerful of the
Flemish noblemen, to go on a mission to Philip in
Spain to beg him to relax his persecutions.</p>

<p>William of Orange’s younger brother, Louis, had
also taken up the cause of the Reformers in a whole-hearted
and enthusiastic spirit. He had the advantage
over his brother of being an avowed anti-Catholic,
and being perfectly free and fearless, he was able to
do the most useful work in the way of propaganda
and in inspiring resistance to the Catholics. He
gathered together several violent and reckless young
men, young aristocrats of spirit but of bad reputation,
and he gave these young wastrels something to
think about, something to work and to live for.
Under his leadership they held meetings, and formed
themselves into a League of Protest against the Inquisition,
drawing up, as a result of their meetings,
a petition to the Regent, Margaret of Parma, entitled
<i>The Request</i>. But the writing of it was in such violent
language—though perfectly justifiable in the cir<span class="pagenum">42</span>cumstances—that
Orange, who was more of a statesman
than his brother, could not advise the Regent to
accept it. He believed it would do more harm than
good. But finally it was put into humbler and more
polite language, and being signed by two hundred
nobles and burghers in Holland, it was presented to
the Regent. She was upset, and tried to get out of
giving them any answer to their requests. She assured
them she would ask the King. One of her court
turned to her saying, “Is Your Highness to be terrorized
by these beggars?” and hereafter the Leaguers
took upon themselves this title, and went about in
beggars’ garb of loose grey frieze, a terror to the
Catholics and a great force, as their numbers increased,
in the coming Revolution.</p>

<p>The position of Orange at this time, trying as he
was to keep loyal to the King and yet to protect the
people against him, was becoming more and more difficult
to himself. At thirty, Orange was a very different
man from what he had been at twenty-six. He
had much changed, and was no longer the prosperous
and brilliant grandee of those times, but worn and
thin and sad. He could not sleep. His position was
an impossible one. He could not yet be quite openly
against the Catholics; he saw no prospect at present
of throwing off the Spanish yoke, and he was not
yet prepared for rebellion. He hated what we call
propaganda, and the narrowness of the Calvinists.
He was charged with treason on one side—the Span<span class="pagenum">43</span>ish
rulers regarded him as a rebel—and on the other
he was looked upon by the Beggars as a lukewarm
friend. He was between the devil and the deep sea,
desperate and puzzled and seeing no way out. But
this state of things did not last long. The excesses
of the Spaniards were fast exasperating the Netherlanders.
There were constant small outbreaks of
rebellion, and finally a great riot of image-breaking
in Antwerp. The troops were all recalled, and Orange
was commanded to put down the rebels, to quell
and to destroy them by the most extreme methods.
Tumult, confusion, and outrage were everywhere, and
as Orange refused to punish in the way he was requested,
his command was brought to an end.</p>

<p>The Regent, through the advice of her brother, challenged
him to take the oath “to serve His Majesty,
and to act toward and against all and every as shall
be ordered on his behalf, without limitation or restriction.”
The Prince refused. He might, he said,
be asked to kill his own wife. The Regent, still recognizing
Orange’s power and qualities, and always
hoping to get him on her side, begged him to remain
with her and retain his offices. She pressed him to
meet Egmont and other influential Flemish magnates
to discuss the situation. Orange consented to this,
and, seeing Egmont, begged him not to wait and
become a party to the frightful holocaust of blood
which was about to swamp the Netherlands. Egmont
refused, partly out of loyalty to the sovereign and<span class="pagenum">44</span>
partly out of weakness. Orange, in taking farewell
of him, embraced him and was convinced he would
never see him again. He never did, for Egmont was,
a little later, taken and put to death by the Catholics
as a traitor.</p>

<p>This must have been the moment when Orange
ceased to have any sympathy with the Catholic
Church. But he so far had not joined any other sect,
and had apparently no sympathy with the Calvinism
which he was afterwards to embrace. He retired now
to his palace at Brussels and gave up all his offices.
Philip wrote him sham letters of regret while, secretly,
he advised Alva to seize Orange and bring him to
punishment. They had made their plans, and Orange
was then formally outlawed as a rebel, and his
eldest son, who was at the University, seized and
taken to Spain—his father never saw him again. Orange
left Brussels as an outlaw, retiring to his brother’s
castle of Dillenburg, where he lived with his
mother. Alva then arrived in Brussels at the head
of a Spanish army, one of the most splendid ever
seen—healthy, well-trained, and courageous. The outbursts
of revolt had filled Philip and Granvelle with
a perfect fury of vengeance; there in the depths of
Spain they had been planning and hatching horrible
plots together, and now they set to and worked the
Inquisition for all it was worth. The head Inquisitor,
Piter Titelman, with his underlings, would scour
the country, rushing into people’s houses, dragging<span class="pagenum">45</span>
out so-called heretics, accusing them, and hanging or
burning them without any evidence whatever.</p>

<p>What was the result? The more these fine people
of the Netherlands were trampled on, the stronger
their spirit of resistance grew. Orange set himself
to raise and organize troops to protect them from
Alva. He got together some French Huguenots and
Flemish refugees, but he was doomed for the present
to failure. He had not realized the strength of Alva
as a general and of his magnificently organized troops.
Only the valiant Louis, his brother, managed by extreme
dash and courage to win one victory. Orange
struggled on, in spite of reverses. “With God’s help,”
he writes to his brother, “I am determined to go
on”; but through lack of funds he had to disband
his mercenaries, or paid soldiers, and retire again to
Dillenburg. This was perhaps the most unhappy
period of Orange’s life. He was outlawed and almost
a beggar, for he had sold all he possessed—his jewels,
his plate, and his lands; his wife was showing signs
of losing her mind, and instead of being a comfort
to her husband, she hurled abuse and cruel and unjust
accusations at him, blaming him for all their
misfortunes and giving him no comfort whatever.
Only his wonderful mother stood by him and showed
her strength and understanding until she died.</p>

<p>Still Orange, with his fortunes at their lowest ebb,
did not lose heart or hope. He was lonely and abandoned,
indeed, by most people; his resources seem to<span class="pagenum">46</span>
have come to an end; still he continued to make plans
for saving his country. Every nerve he strained to
get support for his cause. Day and night he worked—sending
messengers to France and England to beg
support and money for troops. He was finally supplied
with eighteen vessels, and, looking back on the
course of the struggle, this seems to have been the
turning-point in the future of the Netherlands. They
were to suffer still untold misfortunes, but from the
moment that the struggle was carried on by sea, so,
in proportion, the Spaniards ceased to tell. “The
Beggars of the Sea,” as they now termed themselves,
were an adventurous and fearless band. They had several
successes, and seized the town of Brill and some
smaller places. The revolt, gaining courage, spread
like fire through Holland and Zeeland, Utrecht and
Friesland; all the principal towns of these provinces
hailed Orange as their leader and submitted themselves
to his authority. Louis of Nassau dashed into
France and seized Valenciennes and Mons. Orange
himself was nearly taken by the Spaniards in a surprise
night attack. They came to his camp when he
was asleep with all his clothes on, as his habit was
then, his arms beside him, and his horse saddled; but
he was awakened by his favorite lapdog, which lay
on his couch. So, in the statues of the Prince in
Delft and The Hague, the little dog lies at his feet
in bronze.</p>

<p>A terrible event now crushed Orange and tempo<span class="pagenum">47</span>rarily
set back the cause of Protestantism and freedom.
This was the Massacre of St. Bartholomew in
Paris, when Coligny, the leader of the Huguenots—the
French Protestants—who had promised to come
to the assistance of Orange, was murdered by the
Catholics.</p>

<p>Orange went to live in Delft, which became his
home. He had made up his mind to cast his lot for
good and all with the Hollanders and Zeelanders in
their struggle for freedom. There in their midst he
continued to inspire their spirit of resistance and independence.
His was the moving spirit which helped
the Dutch gradually by their extraordinary endurance
to wear down the Spanish armies. It was his
spirit, too, that kept the Spanish at bay at the celebrated
siege of Haarlem, when for seven months the
inhabitants endured terrible sufferings—the women
fighting for their lives as well as the men—until they
were starved out. The relief of Leyden was effected
by Orange’s own personal exertions, though ill with
fever.</p>

<p>In 1573 Orange became a Calvinist, so as to identify
himself more completely with the cause he had
at heart. But he was not a bigoted Calvinist any
more than he had been a devoted Catholic. He had
always been ready to respect the good side of every
religion. He never could understand why people
should not live happily together, praying in their
own way. The spirit of Religion appealed to him,<span class="pagenum">48</span>
not the letter or the doctrine. He would have been
content to remain a Catholic, had it not been for the
Church’s persecutions.</p>

<p>Now, his wife, Anne of Saxony, having left him
and become insane, Orange married again for the
third time—Charlotte of Bourbon, who had been a
nun. This gave further offense to the Catholics.</p>

<p>The years 1576–78 were almost the most crowded,
the most desperate, and yet the most triumphant of
William’s life. He was, he writes to his brother, overwhelmed
with work and grief and care. The terrible
Spanish army, storming the cities of the Netherlands
and butchering their inhabitants, seemed to have got
the best of it. Many towns fell to them, and Orange
at one moment felt at the end of his tether, when the
fortunate occurrence of a mutiny for pay in the Spanish
army and the death of its Grand Commander gave
Orange his opportunity. While Philip hesitated, Orange
acted. This brought about the union of Holland
and Zeeland, which is known as the Union of Delft,
a crucial act and the foundation of a great Power
to come. Orange was given supreme authority as
ruler. He was to support the Reformed Religion,
but no inquisition was to be allowed into any man’s
faith or conscience. For not only had Orange to fight
the Catholics, but he had to hold back the Calvinists,
who, immediately their power and numbers increased,
revenged themselves most horribly on those of different
creeds. The horrors of the Spanish Fury con<span class="pagenum">49</span>tinued
to increase. William called a conference of
the States General and drew up the Pacification of
Ghent. By this treaty all the seventeen provinces
bound themselves into a solemn league to expel the
Spaniards, and made it law that the ultimate settlement
of all questions was to rest with the States
General.</p>

<p>William’s appeals to the people of the Netherlands
were masterpieces of eloquence and reason. He put
it that disunion had been their ruin—union would
save them. A stick is, he said, easily broken; a faggot
of sticks bound together resists. He appealed
not only to Protestants but to Catholics, asking them
not to be taken in by the superstitious idea that loyalty
means absolutely cringing to the every wish of
a king, who is probably of all the people the most
ignorant as to all that is being done in his name.
The States were stirred by his appeals, and the Pacification
was hailed with shouts of joy and relief. Orange
at this moment reached the height of his career,
and he was persuaded by his people to make a public
entry into Brussels as their acknowledged leader. He
received a tremendously enthusiastic and brilliant welcome.
A little later, however, he had to suffer disappointment
in the breaking away of the Southern
from the Northern Netherlands. The persecution in
the South had done its work and Philip gained the
allegiance of Belgium. Henceforward they had separate
histories and are known as Holland and Bel<span class="pagenum">50</span>gium.
In his further struggles against Philip, Orange
felt scarcely strong enough to hold his United
Provinces without assistance from another country.
He turned to France, offering to make the Duc d’Anjou,
brother of the French King, sovereign of the
United Provinces. His offer was accepted. The Duke
proved to be a weak and treacherous man; he was
a complete failure, and, making himself odious and
impossible to his subjects, his rule was brought to
an end.</p>

<p>The awful Granvelle had meanwhile whispered to
Philip that they might assassinate Orange (1580),
and they finally drew up together a ban putting a
price upon the Prince’s head. They declared him a
traitor and as such banished him “perpetually from
our realms.”</p>

<p>Orange, living quietly with his wife at Delft, took
it very calmly. He showed no fear; the Lord, he
said, would dispose as He thought fit. But he wrote
and published his famous <i>Apology</i>, a very lengthy
document which is interesting as a history of his life.
In it he answers the accusations brought against him
in the ban—that he is a foreigner, a heretic, an enemy,
a rebel, and so on.</p>

<p>The ban soon began to bear fruit, and several attempts
were made on the Prince’s life; one, a year
later, was very nearly successful. A youth offered him
a petition, and as Orange took it he discharged a pistol
at the Prince’s head. The bullet went through his<span class="pagenum">51</span>
neck and through the roof of his mouth, carrying
away some teeth. The Prince was blinded and
stunned. When he came to his senses he called out,
“Don’t kill him! I forgive him my death.” Every
one thought he had been mortally wounded, and
crowds went to the churches to offer up prayers for
his recovery; and he did recover, but his poor wife
Charlotte, who had nursed him devotedly, died of
the shock. This had been a perfect marriage, lasting
seven years, and Charlotte had had six daughters, all
of whom had afterwards interesting and eventful histories.
A year later William married Louise de Coligny,
the daughter of the famous French general.
She was one of the noblest and most attractive women
of her day, and gave her husband one son, a remarkable
person and the first of many illustrious Stadtholders.</p>

<p>In Delft, William with his wife, surrounded by his
many children, ranging in age from two to nearly
thirty years, lived a very happy, simple life. Their
large plain house was in a pleasant street planted
with lime-trees, so that in June the surface of the
canal they looked upon was covered with their fallen
blossoms. There in the street William of Orange
would sometimes be seen looking like any ordinary
burgher, very plainly dressed in a loose coat of gray
frieze over a tawny leather doublet, a high ruff round
his neck and a wide-brimmed hat of dark felt with a
cord round it. In appearance, Orange was rather<span class="pagenum">52</span>
tall, well-made and strong, but thin. His hair and
complexion were brown, and his eyes were brown,
too, and very bright and large. His head was small
and well-shaped, but the brow was broad, and now,
late in life, very much wrinkled and furrowed with
thought and care. His mouth was firmly closed and
rather melancholy. His whole appearance was that
of a man of great strength of character and of self-control.
At this time, though weary after many strenuous
years of toil, he was never more cheerful, amusing,
and sympathetic. He was busy still as the practical
ruler of his devoted people—“Father of the
Country,” as they called him; but when the States
begged him to become their sovereign he refused. He
had quite enough reward and consolation, he said, in
the devotion of Holland and Zeeland, and he wanted
rest in his advanced age. He was only fifty-one, but
no doubt felt old, for he was old in experience and
sorrow, and so he asked to be excused more cares and
responsibilities.</p>



<p class="tb">In the summer of 1584, the Prince was one day
with his wife going to his dining-room for dinner,
when a man presented himself at the door of the
dining-room and demanded a passport. The Princess
was so much alarmed at the man’s looks that she
asked her husband about him. The Prince said he
was only a man who wanted a passport, and ordered
his secretary to prepare one. He then ate his meal<span class="pagenum">53</span>
quite calmly and happily, and at the end of it walked
out of the room leading the way to his own apartments
up some stairs. He had just begun to ascend
them when a figure emerged from a dark archway
near the staircase and shot a pistol straight at the
Prince’s heart. One bullet went right through him,
and he, feeling his wound, cried out, “Oh, my God,
have mercy upon my soul! Oh, my God, have mercy
upon this poor people!” and then he died.</p>

<p>The murderer’s name was Balthazar Gerard. He
had pretended to be a Calvinist, and in this manner
had approached Orange with all sorts of pathetic
stories to arouse his sympathy, and had got to know
all Orange’s habits and movements. Now he was
seized by the Prince’s devoted people and, in the barbarous
custom of that day, tortured in a most hideous
fashion until he died, all of which he bore with great
bravery. He was an absolute fanatic, and believed
he was doing a very fine thing in ridding the world
of Orange. Being dead, he could not receive himself
the reward promised by Philip, but his parents
were enriched and ennobled for their son’s act.</p>

<p>The Great Leader was no more, and it is easy to
picture the indignation and misery among his people.
How were they to get on without his kind, commanding
figure, without his tact, his patience and resolution?
His death was indeed a calamity which put
back the fortunes of the Netherlands for many years,
for his second son Maurice, who became Governor,<span class="pagenum">54</span>
was only seventeen years old, and it was hard work
to continue the struggle. But Orange’s labors had
not been in vain. He was the real founder of the
Dutch Republic, and he knew before he died that
the cause he had suffered for would at last succeed,
that the Hollanders were now in a position to offer
successful resistance to Philip. And his blood ran,
too, in the veins of many noble descendants—his children,
and later his grandchildren and great-grandchildren,
who were to carry on his work. Some inherited
his extraordinary powers of statesmanship and
others became great soldiers.</p>

<p>William of Orange, like all great men of character,
had his enemies and critics. He was accused
of being governed by ambition and the desire to see
himself in high positions. He has been called insincere,
and even accused of cowardice on the field of
battle. If we study his life carefully it seems to be
a complete refutation of these accusations. If he had
only cared for high posts and honors, how easily he
might have retained them! He need not have taken
the line he did against Philip. He might, as he was
a Catholic, have overcome the feeling he had that
persecution was an intolerable thing and agreed to
the general system of Inquisition. In the beginning
he owed everything to Charles V, so it was not natural
or possible to throw over his son immediately.
Besides, he was a statesman—one of the greatest of<span class="pagenum">55</span>
that age: he wanted to do the best for his country.
Like many open-minded persons, he was able to see
two sides to a question and to see it in its widest
sense. He was tolerant and ahead of his times. To
be all this in an age of bigotry and intolerance was
to be insincere.</p>

<p>By circumstance William the Silent was placed in
an extremely difficult position, and all must admit
that he came out of it with the greatest glory. His
troubles came upon him only because he was too
honest. It is a difficult thing to understand, but a
man’s sufferings and troubles are often a result of
his own finest qualities, and so it was with Orange.
As to his lack of physical bravery, his life was also
a living contradiction of this criticism, as witness
his indifference to the ban put upon him. It did not
make him in the least nervous, and he took no precautions
for protecting himself against assassins. For
years, too, his life was spent on the field of battle,
meeting with great reverses and hairbreadth escapes,
yet he never shirked it, but endured and faced it. It
is true that, unlike his brother Louis, he had no actual
joy in battle. His blood was not stirred by the clash
of arms, for he was not naturally a soldier, any more
than he was a rebel; circumstances and his own fair-mindedness
had made him so; while rebelling against
an utterly unfair and unlawful condition of things,
he used all his powers to moderate people’s passions,<span class="pagenum">56</span>
and to make them live peacefully together. The end
part of his life was spent in drawing up laws to that
purpose.</p>

<p>In thinking over the character of Orange, the fact
that strikes one most is that his character deepened
and strengthened as he grew older and in proportion
to his sufferings. If he had not been tried to the
very limit by misfortunes, and if he had always been
rich and prosperous, the finest things in his character
might have remained untried and unknown to
us. We should not have realized that beside his
charming qualities, his great understanding of men,
his gentleness and generosity, there lay heroic qualities
of endurance, devotion, and courage. That he
should not by nature have been an ascetic, despising
amusements, good food, and fine clothes, and the
lighter side of existence, but an aristocrat, easygoing,
enjoying possessions and the beauty of life, and with
some human weaknesses, only draws us more closely
to him, for it makes us understand the struggles and
difficulties he had to overcome in himself in order
to do what he did. He gave away everything he had,
and at one time possessed hardly the common necessaries
of life, so that he was almost a beggar as well
as an outlaw. In the darkest hours of his life he
tried to smile and to appear cheerful for the sake of
his people, and to encourage them, which made his
enemies say he was flippant and heartless. But he
was a truly religious man, inheriting from his mother<span class="pagenum">57</span>
the religious spirit—reverence and belief in good and
trust in God.</p>

<p>In the words of Motley, “He went through life
bearing the load of a people’s sorrow upon his shoulders
with a smiling face, and when he died the little
children cried in the streets.”</p>

<h2>III<br /><br />

TYCHO BRAHE<br /><br />

1546–1601</h2>



<p class="center"><small>Esse potius quam haberi</small></p>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is a small island called Hveen which lies in
the Sound half-way between the coasts of Denmark
and Sweden and about ten miles north of Copenhagen.
It looks now a rather desolate and abandoned
place. But if you had been alive about the year 1580
and had gone there, you would have been very much
surprised at what you found. On landing you would
have seen right above you in the middle of the island,
rising up out of the trees, a wonderful castle with
galleries and turrets and gilded spires, just like a palace
in a fairy tale. Let us imagine it was summer,
and you were very bold and wended your way up the
rocks through a grove of fruit trees into a lovely garden
with avenues and terraces and fountains and
gorgeous flower-beds. An attendant is standing in
the porch, and you ask him to show you round, as you
are naturally curious to see what the inside of such
a place is like. The inside is even more surprising.<span class="pagenum">60</span>
As you pass through the hall and along the stone
corridors lit by stained-glass windows, the song of
caged birds, the splash of fountains, and the distant
sound of music greet your ear. You notice Latin inscriptions
painted over the doors and rich decoration
on all sides.</p>

<p>Through the windows of the spacious rooms filled
with carved furniture and decorated with pictures and
tapestries you catch a glimpse of a glorious view of
the Swedish and Danish coast, with the towers of
Copenhagen in the far distance. In the great library
there are cabinets of rare and beautiful objects: the
walls are lined with books: the tables are piled with
papers all covered with numbers and geometrical figures:
curious-looking instruments stand on the
shelves: an enormous brass globe occupies one corner
of the room and a complicated-looking clock, all
wheels and works, stands in another. Down in the
basement you find a vast apartment where masses of
bottles and crucibles and retorts and glasses filled
with strange-colored mixtures are ranged on shelves
and tables. Who on earth lives in such a place as
this? you ask the attendant. It is the Castle of Uraniborg,
he tells you, the home of the Danish astronomer
Tycho Brahe—the greatest astronomer of the
age—who is known as “the noblest of the learned
and the most learned of the nobles,” and he whispers
under his breath that he is a magician.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a id="p60" name="p60">
<img src="images/i_fp060.jpg" width="500" height="673" alt="TYCHO BRAHE" /></a>
<div class="caption">TYCHO BRAHE</div>
</div>

<p>Laughter and the sound of animated voices reach
<span class="pagenum">61</span>you as you pass the door of the banqueting hall. Your
informant explains that there are guests in the castle—a
prince and his suite have spent the day there,
and some learned men from foreign lands form part
of the company. The evening is closing in, and attendants
come hurrying from all quarters carrying books
and instruments; a student from one of the observatories
in the towers goes into the hall to inform his
master that the night is clear. Through the open doorway
you catch sight of the great man himself, sitting
at the end of his dining-table, discoursing vivaciously
to his guests. He is a broad-shouldered, burly-looking
man, with short, bright red hair and a thick mustache
curling over an auburn beard. But what an odd
nose he has got! it seems to shine like metal. It <i>is</i>
metal, the attendant tells you: for once, as a student,
he fought a duel with another student, and his adversary
got the best of it and slashed Tycho’s nose right
off with his sword. He made himself a new nose out
of a mixture of gold and silver, which he stuck on
and wore for the rest of his life. Crouching at the
foot of his chair you observe a funny little dwarf, his
jester, who from time to time takes morsels of food
from his hand and interrupts the conversation with
some ridiculous joke.</p>

<p>Soon the banquet is over, the procession passes out,
and you notice how grandly the astronomer is dressed,
with doublet and white ruff, a sword at his side, a
chain of gold round his neck. The prince and his<span class="pagenum">62</span>
courtiers do not appear more magnificent. Is it out
of compliment to his guests? No, you are told; when
he goes to watch the stars, even alone, he always
dresses like this, as if he were some great ambassador
accredited by the earth to the heavens.</p>

<p>The guests walk across the castle yard, down a
flight of steps to a domed subterranean building not
far off called Stjerneborg—the castle of the stars—which
is entirely given up to astronomical requirements,
the only decoration on the walls being portraits
of astronomers, including one of Tycho himself.
There, when the prince has left the island and the
other guests have retired to rest, the astronomer will
remain rapt in contemplation of the mysteries of the
universe.</p>

<p class="tb">Our remotest ancestors were struck with awe and
interest when they looked at the heavens. They believed
them to be the residence of God, and at the
same time they were their clock and calendar. Astronomy
is a very ancient science. It was practised
by the Egyptians, the Chinese, and the Babylonians
in the remotest ages of history, as well as by the
Arabs and Greeks. The most marvelous discoveries
have been made with regard to the number and motion
of the stars since the days when primæval man looked
on the heavens as a great blue vault “fretted with
golden fire.” It may have been thought once that the<span class="pagenum">63</span>
stars could be numbered. The telescope and photography
have shown this to be impossible, and have
taught us the overwhelming fact that our universe
contains, at the very least, one hundred millions of
suns, and that the light from some of the most distant
stars has taken over 18,000 years to reach us!
This seems very bewildering, though not more so than
to know that there are animals so minute that if a
thousand of them were ranged abreast they would
easily swim, without being thrown out of line, through
the eye of the finest needle. We live in the midst
of incomprehensible marvels, infinitely great and infinitely
small, between the limitless future and the
limitless past.</p>

<p>What wonderful patience and toil it must have required
for the astronomers of all nations, working
together and comparing notes, to store up the vast
amount of knowledge of the heavens which we now
possess. It is amazing, too, to think how three or
four hundred years ago they were able to make so
many discoveries and calculations without the aid of
a telescope. For before 1600 the telescope was practically
unknown. So when you see standing in a
modern observatory gigantic instruments, thirty or
forty feet long, of marvelous ingenuity and highly
complicated mechanism, which in spite of their size
and weight are capable of being moved by a hair’s
breadth and adjusted to the hundredth part of an<span class="pagenum">64</span>
inch: their object-glasses alone perhaps over thirty
inches in diameter, costing thousands of dollars; and
then you think of these early astronomers gazing
through a hole in a vaulted roof at the tiny specks
of light with their naked eye, the work they accomplished
appears still more astounding. It is true that
their discoveries were at first casual and haphazard.
But at last it occurred to one of them that the progress
of astronomy depended on continuous observation
and the most scrupulously accurate calculations,
carefully planned and carried on over a number of
years. It was Tycho Brahe who first did this.</p>

<p>You have heard of Copernicus, the Pole, who was
really the founder of modern astronomy, because he
discovered that the earth went round the sun and
was not the center of the universe, as every one had
supposed. He died three years before Tycho Brahe
was born. Galileo, the famous Italian, was born in
1564 and lived till he was seventy-eight. He made
further discoveries about the stars and used a telescope
of a very primitive kind. He supported Copernicus’s
theory with regard to the relative movement
of the earth and the sun, and this brought upon him
the serious displeasure of the Church. The notion
that the earth was not the center of the universe was
considered wicked and blasphemous. The Pope commanded
him to come to Rome, and after a long trial
he was made, under the threat of torture, to retract
what he had said. The story is that as he turned<span class="pagenum">65</span>
away at the end of his trial he stamped his foot on
the ground and muttered: “E pur si muove!” (And
yet it <i>does</i> move!)</p>

<p>Kepler is another well-known astronomer, of whom
we shall hear again. These three are all more eminent
men than Tycho Brahe, whose fame does not depend
on any startling discovery, but on the fact that he
devised wonderful instruments, and by unceasing energy
and industry collected a mass of material which
was of untold value to his successors. But perhaps
most of all it is his romantic life and his strong character
which make him stand out in history.</p>

<p>Tycho was born in 1546 and was the eldest of ten
children. His father, Otto Brahe, was lord of Knudstrup
in Scaane, which now forms part of Sweden.
At an early age he was adopted by his uncle, Jorgen
Brahe, who treated him as if he were his son, had him
educated at Copenhagen, but by spoiling him a good
deal was no doubt responsible for the somewhat conceited
and domineering manner he developed in later
years. At the age of fourteen Tycho received what
might be termed his “call” from the heavens. It
came in the form of an eclipse of the sun, which
roused the boy’s interest to such an extent that from
that moment he made up his mind to turn his attention
to astronomy. It is a curious fact that ten years
later, when chemistry had so absorbed him that he
had almost abandoned his astronomical studies, he
again received a sign from the heavens. This time<span class="pagenum">66</span>
it was the appearance of a new star which he observed
one night while walking from his laboratory,
and which caused him to take up again the beloved
pursuit of which he never wearied to his dying day.
He discovered the new star, and it may be equally
truly said that the star discovered him. But at first
the idea of his devoting his time to astronomy was
not at all favored or encouraged. After he had spent
three years in the Copenhagen University his uncle
sent him to Leipzig, where it was intended he should
study law. His tutor, who accompanied him, conscientiously
tried to make Tycho devote all his attention
and time to his legal studies, but his task was
almost hopeless. It is impossible to force any one to
take an interest in something he does not like. These
obstacles only served to strengthen Tycho’s resolve.
He devoured every book he could find on astronomy,
and at night, unknown to his tutor, he would creep
out and begin his first intercourse with the stars. A
copy of Ptolemy’s great work on astronomy, copiously
annotated and marked by the schoolboy, is preserved
as one of the chief treasures in the library of the
University at Prague.</p>

<p>While he was thus engaged a fatal accident befell
his uncle. Jorgen Brahe was riding in attendance
on the King of Denmark when a bridge collapsed
under them. He plunged into the water and attempted
to save the King’s life. In consequence of this he
contracted a chill, which soon afterwards caused his<span class="pagenum">67</span>
death. Tycho hurried home to Copenhagen, but he
did not stay long. He returned to Germany and continued
his studies at Wittenberg, the home of the
great Reformer Luther, who had been dead only about
twenty years. He seems to have had no desire to go
home, for he settled down at Rostock and then at
Augsburg, where he was fortunate enough to find
many scientific men with whom he could associate
and exchange ideas. Here it was that he invented
and constructed some remarkable astronomical instruments,
one of which was that enormous globe
you saw in his library. It was four feet in diameter,
and covered with a coating of brass on which was
engraved a representation of the heavens founded on
his own observations.</p>

<p>Otto Brahe, who was governor of Helsingborg Castle,
died in 1570, and Tycho returned to Denmark to
arrange his father’s affairs. Another uncle placed his
house at the disposal of his remarkable young nephew,
and soon Tycho was eagerly watching his new star,
about which he wrote a book in Latin. There was
some difficulty about publishing the book, because it
was supposed to be beneath the dignity of a nobleman
to demean himself by writing books. However,
by the assistance of friends, it was published and
added very much to his reputation. This was an age
when nobles and aristocrats had great power and
dominated the country. Like nobles in all ages, physical
work in time of peace or mental work of any<span class="pagenum">68</span>
kind was beneath their dignity: they occupied most
of their time in pleasure and amusement. They considered
themselves the elect, who were born to be
served. Although he belonged by birth to this class,
Tycho detested the frivolous, aimless lives they led.
In a letter in which he expresses his intention of leaving
Denmark, he says:</p>


<p class="small">Neither my country nor my friends keep me back; one
who has courage finds a home in every place and lives a
happy life every where. Friends, too, one can find in all
countries. There will always be time enough to return to
the cold North to follow the general example, and, like the
rest, in pride and luxury to play for the rest of one’s years
with wine, dogs, and horses (for if these were lacking how
could the nobles be happy?). May God, as I trust He will,
accord me a better lot.</p>

<p>He traveled about in Germany, Austria, and Italy,
and he made great friends with the Landgrave of
Hesse, who was very much interested in mathematics
and astronomy and had a fine observatory of his own.
While Tycho was staying with him at Cassel a serious
fire broke out in the palace. But such was the astronomer’s
power of concentration and absorption in his
work that, regardless of the general alarm, he could
not be persuaded to leave his study until he had finished
the particular piece of work with which he was
occupied at the moment.</p>

<p>The fame of the great astronomer was now spreading,
and the King of Denmark, Frederick II, who<span class="pagenum">69</span>
heard his praises sung by the Landgrave of Hesse, was
determined to show his appreciation of the remarkable
talents of his subject in a practical way. He
therefore presented Tycho Brahe with the island of
Hveen, in the Baltic, as his own personal property,
with sufficient money to erect on it whatever buildings
he might desire. The foundation of the great castle
was laid on August 30, 1576. A party of scientific
friends had assembled, and the time had been chosen
so that the heavenly bodies were auspiciously placed.
Libations of costly wines were poured forth and the
stone was laid with due solemnity. Here at Uraniborg,
the castle you visited, he lived for about twenty
years, keeping a diary not only of astronomical observations
but of all events that passed on the island.</p>

<p>The peasants on the island, whom he doctored and
to whom he gave medicines for nothing, regarded him
of course as a wizard, and a number of strange legends
were circulated about the magician and his wonderful
castle. Many visitors came to visit him at Uraniborg
from all parts of the world—distinguished astronomers,
mathematicians, philosophers, divines, princes
and kings. Queen Sophie of Denmark came on several
occasions and brought her father, Duke Ulrich of
Mecklenburg. In 1590 James VI of Scotland, who
thirteen years later became James I of England, came
over to marry Princess Anne of Denmark. She had
intended to go to the home of her betrothed, but owing
to stormy weather had been wrecked off the coast<span class="pagenum">70</span>
of Norway. James therefore, who rather feared that
Queen Elizabeth might interfere and upset his plans
of marriage, sailed forth himself to fetch his bride.
The marriage was celebrated at Oslo, on the coast of
Norway, and the royal couple came subsequently on
a visit to Copenhagen. James took the opportunity
to visit Uraniborg, and was very much interested in
Tycho Brahe’s work. On leaving the island he asked
what he should give the astronomer in return for his
hospitality. Tycho, like a true courtier, replied:
“Some of your Majesty’s own verses.” The King
was delighted and readily acquiesced. Tycho’s opinion
of the literary efforts of the poet King is not recorded.
Queen Elizabeth’s Minister at the Court of
Denmark also visited the island, and Duncan Liddel,
the Scottish astronomer.</p>

<p>Tycho was a great talker; he had a somewhat overbearing
and arrogant manner, and was intolerant and
contemptuous with those whom he considered to be
his inferiors intellectually. But although he was conceited
he was thoroughly genuine, and despised the
shams and artificialities of life. His motto was <i>Esse
potius quam haberi</i> (To be rather than to seem to be).
That is to say, he did not value reputation and fame
unless it was accompanied by real accomplishment.
He preferred working hard for the pure satisfaction
of doing good work, even if it were not recognized,
and he despised people who got credit and fame without
really deserving it. He was quite right. And<span class="pagenum">71</span>
it is worth remembering that many people who are
doing valuable work in the world remain absolutely
unknown: while many of the names which appear
most frequently before the public are those of men
who have become famous by chance and not by merit.</p>

<p>In addition to being an astronomer, Tycho was a
skilled mechanic, mathematician, and architect: he
wrote verses which were much admired and was a
great lover of music. It was only natural in such
an age that a man who devoted himself to astronomy
and chemistry should believe in astrology and
alchemy; and it is not to be wondered at that Tycho
Brahe should have attempted to find some connection
between the movements of the stars and the course
of events in the lives of men. When the King of Denmark
asked him to cast the horoscope of some of the
young princes, that is to say, foretell their future by
the position of the stars at the time of their birth,
he did it very elaborately, but with a caution that too
much reliance should not be placed on such prophecies.
His first attempt at prophesying was anything
but successful. He said the eclipse of the moon in
1566 meant that the Turkish Sultan would die. Presently
the news arrived of the Sultan’s death, but it
appeared that it had taken place <i>before</i> the eclipse—a
fact which caused people to laugh at Tycho’s expense.
But he certainly made one very singular prediction
from the appearance of the comet of 1577. It
announced, he declared, that in the north, in Finland,<span class="pagenum">72</span>
there would be born a prince who would lay waste
Germany and vanish in 1632. Now, Gustavus Adolphus,
the King of Sweden, was born in Finland, overran
Germany, and died in 1632.</p>

<p>Tycho, indeed, was superstitious by nature. If he
met an old woman or a hare on going out, he took
it as a bad omen and would return home; and he often
listened attentively to the sayings and prophecies of
Jeppe, his dwarf jester.</p>

<p>It is not surprising that such a man as this did not
marry one of his own class. A lady of the nobility
would have been too frightened to lead such an adventurous
life and an educated woman would have refused
to submit to so domineering and tyrannical
a nature in a husband. When he was twenty-seven
he married a poor peasant girl by whose beauty he
had been struck, and she seems to have been more of
a servant than a companion to him.</p>

<p>The glories of the Castle of Uraniborg were not
destined to last for long, and no one was to blame
for this but Tycho himself, though he certainly had
enemies who were jealous of him, and who were only
too ready to take advantage of the decline in his fortunes.
A series of unpleasant incidents, combined
with his somewhat restless and discontented spirit,
forced him at last to abandon his magnificent home
and to leave his native land for good. He had neglected
his duties, squandered his money, and displeased
people by his views. The peasants on the<span class="pagenum">73</span>
island complained of ill-treatment. A disagreeable
lawsuit with regard to his daughter’s marriage worried
him, and many of his influential friends at court
had died or retired. He addressed a letter to the
King of Denmark, Christian IV, the son of his original
patron, Frederick II, hoping to be restored to favor,
but he was sternly rebuked and his pension was withdrawn.
A poem lamenting over the ingratitude of
Denmark shows with what keen regret he left the
country. It must have been a tragic moment when
all his instruments and treasures were packed up and
the castle and observatory left deserted. There is
hardly any trace even of the ruins on the island to-day.
The truth is that a man engaged in intellectual
work is only hampered by such lavish patronage.
Tycho’s head was turned, and indeed he would have
required to have a very strong character to remain
unaffected in such peculiar conditions.</p>

<p>Undismayed, however, by temporary bad fortune,
the astronomer, after a year or so of travel, during
which he never ceased from his work, turned from
one royal patron to another. He was received at
Prague in 1599 by the Emperor Rudolph the Second,
who pensioned him and gave him the castle of
Benatke, near by, where he established himself and
his family and set up at once an observatory. Comfortable
as he was, still he yearned for his fatherland
and never forgot the great generosity of his
munificent friend, King Frederick II.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">74</span></p>

<p>Among the disciples and assistants who gathered
round him here was Johann Kepler, whom we mentioned
before. He was then twenty-eight years old,
and lived to become an even greater astronomer than
Tycho Brahe himself. He owed a great deal to the
profound and extensive observations of his master on
the subject of fixed stars, and with the aid of all the
careful information which Tycho had gathered together
and bequeathed to his favorite pupil on his
death, he made important discoveries with regard to
the movements of the planets, and elaborated a much
more advanced idea of the universe. Curiously
enough, Tycho Brahe, with all his astonishing industry,
never completely accepted the system of Copernicus.
His idea was that the earth was the center
of the universe and the sun formed the center for
the orbits of the planets, but the sun itself, together
with the planets, moved round the earth.</p>

<p>By his diligent observation of a thousand fixed stars,
he gave to the world a catalogue of accurate positions
of these bodies which took the place of the old catalogue
of Ptolemy of Alexandria, who lived in the second
century. This catalogue of observations held its
own for more than a hundred years, until telescopes
and clocks of precision came into use. It was the
mighty impulse that Tycho Brahe gave to practical
astronomy that caused that science to be taken up
at universities, among which those of Copenhagen
and Leyden were the first to found observatories.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">75</span></p>

<p>In 1601, at the age of fifty-five, Tycho Brahe died
after a short illness. He was accorded by the Emperor’s
orders a funeral of great pomp, and buried
in the Teyn Church at Prague. In the funeral oration
pronounced over his grave he was well described
thus:</p>


<p class="small">In his words were truth and brevity, in his demeanor
and countenance sincerity, in his counsel wisdom, in his
deeds success. In him was nothing artificial or hypocritical,
but he spoke his mind straight out, and to this no
doubt is due the hatred with which many regarded him.
He coveted nothing but time, and his endeavor was to be
of service to all and hurtful to none.</p>

<p>The tomb, with the effigy of the great Danish astronomer
and the epitaph composed by Kepler, was restored
and put in order in 1901, on the celebration
of the three-hundredth anniversary of his death.</p>

<p>By his wonderful industry Tycho Brahe laid the
foundations on which others were able to build up
great inventions and great discoveries. A discoverer
or inventor may only put the finishing touch to the
labor of others who have gone before him, preparing
the way. Their names may not be known, their work
may be forgotten, while he gets all the praise and renown
for the famous achievement, which, however,
without the help of his predecessors he could never
have accomplished. You may see a man trying to
pull a stiff cork out of a bottle. He fails. Another<span class="pagenum">76</span>
man tries. He too fails. A third man tries and out
it comes. “Ah,” every one says, “he has done what
the others could not do.” But the truth is that he
succeeded because the first two men loosened the cork
before him. Much of the great preparatory toil of
the world’s work has been done by men and women
whose names do not appear in any record. Tycho,
however, did leave his mark, for it was not usual for
a man of noble birth to devote his time to arduous
study.</p>

<p>By far the greater number of men who are famous
in history, especially those who have achieved renown
in science and the arts, have been men of humble
origin who have had to work for their living and
even struggle against the adversity which poverty
brings. It is this very struggle and continuous effort
that is the making of them. Those who are born in
more fortunate circumstances, and are surrounded by
luxury and comfort which tempt them to lead lives
of ease and idleness rarely succeed in accomplishing
notable achievements. Alexander Humboldt, who
lived at the end of the eighteenth and the beginning
of the nineteenth century, is another notable instance
of a man of high position (and in his case, too, considerable
means) giving up his life to an untiring pursuit
of knowledge and to amassing a remarkable
amount of valuable scientific information.</p>

<p>To work when you need not work, to prevent your
time being wasted in pleasure and amusements and<span class="pagenum">77</span>
your efforts being relaxed by comforts and luxuries,
is perhaps even more difficult than the struggle against
necessity and poverty. Only a few great men brought
up in such circumstances have succeeded. Tycho
Brahe was one of them, and it is very greatly to his
credit that by strength of will and character he overcame
to the extent he did these formidable obstacles.</p>

<p><small>Leisure, an agreeable residence, pleasant fields, serene skies, murmuring

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is not often that great men are recognized in
their lifetime. They may have a few admirers, but
their work is probably the subject of dispute and disagreement,
and not till years have passed, and the
smaller men who attracted momentary attention have
been forgotten, are they valued at last at their true
worth. Thus it may happen that men who are talked
about a great deal, and rather noisily praised by their
contemporaries, disappear almost entirely from the
memory of man in succeeding generations, while men
who in their day have despaired of success, have been
neglected, and have sometimes felt the humiliation of
failure, live on in their work long after their death and
exercise an influence more far-reaching than they
themselves ever dreamed of.</p>

<p>Of course you have heard of Don Quixote, and you<span class="pagenum">80</span>
have probably read some of his amusing adventures—how
he went about with his funny little squire, Sancho
Panza, and gave proof of his heroism in many diverting
ways. But the book in which his adventures are
written is not only an entertaining story—it is a wonderfully
accurate picture of Spanish life in the sixteenth
century, and is a record of many interesting
events that took place outside Spain as well. When
it was published in 1605, the book was very popular
in Spain, but nobody thought it was going to become
one of the world’s greatest books, no one guessed that
it would be translated into more foreign languages
than any other book in the world except the Bible
and Bunyan’s “Pilgrim’s Progress.” No one, therefore,
paid much attention to the author, and his very
birthplace was not even remembered after he died.
But when the Spaniards found that Cervantes had
become famous throughout the world, then they took
the trouble to unearth something about his history,
and it was found that he had a claim to fame as a
man, apart from his renown as an author.</p>

<p>Cervantes was a soldier. It is not usual for a soldier
to write imaginative books. But he was not a
soldier in a regular army, drilling every day in a
barrack square, but a soldier who went out and fought,
endured fearful hardships, and had the most terrible
adventures. He gained in this way a very wide knowledge
of the world, which, combined with his powerful
<span class="pagenum">81</span>imagination, made him into one of the world’s great
geniuses.</p>

<div class="caption">CERVANTES</div>
</div>

<p>Let us try and follow him through the main events
of his crowded life. Miguel de Cervantes was born
in 1547. Alcala de Henares in New Castille was his
birthplace, but very little is known of his childhood.
As a boy he used to watch the strolling players in the
town, and he relates details of his recollection of
them which remained stamped on his memory. They
would come round and give performances in the market
square. Their properties consisted of a sack which
held four white sheepskin dresses trimmed with gilt
leather, four beards, wigs, and crooks. The decoration
of the theater was an old blanket hung on two
ropes. One can well imagine that their performances
and the verses of the comedies remained with him
vividly when he was grown up. His education was
supposed to have been neglected because he never went
to a university. But if he made mistakes in his writings
which a man who had passed examinations would
have avoided, he managed to obtain a knowledge of
men and life—a more important knowledge, which
many a ripe scholar might envy. At an early age he
tried his hand at writing, and at twenty-one his poems,
on the death of the Queen of Spain, were especially
praised by his tutor.</p>

<p>Years were destined to pass before Cervantes settled
down to any literary work. I expect he knew<span class="pagenum">82</span>
he had the talent, but there was very little chance
for him to test it. He liked adventure and wanted
to be up and doing, so he seized the first opportunity
he could of gaining some experience of the world outside
his own country. He went to Rome and became
a page in the household of an envoy of the Pope whose
acquaintance he had made in Madrid. But this did
not suit him, because the life of a page or chamberlain
was intolerably slow and uneventful. Bowing
and scraping, entertaining and intriguing, was not
in his line at all. He resigned his post and enlisted
as a soldier in a Spanish regiment in Italy. Pope
Pius V was organizing at that time a Holy League
against the Turks, whose great conquests were alarming
the States of Europe. But there was some difficulty
in getting European nations to agree to any
plan for attacking Turkey. They were jealous of one
another and would not all act together. At last, after
a long delay, which was spent by Cervantes in Naples,
the League, consisting of the Pope, Venice, and Spain,
was organized under the command of the famous Don
John of Austria, a brilliant general, who was half-brother
of King Philip II of Spain. The fleet of these
three States was the largest that had ever sailed under
a Christian flag. It consisted of galleys rowed by a
large number of oarsmen, who were all criminals
under sentence. In the Turkish fleet the oarsmen
were Christian slaves. The object of the allies was
to recover Cyprus from the Turks. But before they<span class="pagenum">83</span>
could reach so far a great naval engagement took
place in the Gulf of Lepanto, at the entrance of the
Gulf of Corinth. After some hard fighting the allied
fleets were victorious.</p>

<p>Miguel de Cervantes, though he was acting only
as a common soldier, behaved with conspicuous heroism.
Weak with fever which he had caught at Naples,
he insisted, in spite of protests, on obtaining the command
of a dozen men, and stood with them in a position
exposed to the hottest fire of the enemy. From
his ship he boarded one of the Turkish galleys and
received three gunshot wounds—two in the breast and
one shattering his left hand, which was maimed for
the rest of his life. His conduct won for him the
applause of all his comrades, and he always looked
back on this episode as the most glorious in his career.</p>

<p>Twenty thousand Turks perished, and a hundred
and seventy of their galleys were captured in this
memorable fight at Lepanto, which, if it did not destroy,
anyhow arrested the power of Turkey. A great
storm followed the victory, and Don John sailed away
to Messina with his wounded men, whom he landed
there. Cervantes, whose wounds were very severe,
was among them. He received a special grant of
money for his distinguished service. But so eager
was he to be at the front again that it was not long
before he had joined Don John in his second attempt
to overcome the Turkish fleet, which, however, was
unsuccessful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">84</span></p>

<p>A campaign in Africa followed and Tunis was captured,
soon, however, to be recaptured by the Turks,
whose power remained unbroken. These expeditions
occupied nearly four years, and Cervantes went
through the experience of the hardships of war, the
joy of victory, and the despair of defeat. He was
now a sick and maimed soldier who had witnessed
deeds of knightly valor, but had also known the wearisome
delays, the failures, and the disappointments of
a soldier’s life.</p>

<p>Having been away for six years, he asked leave to
return to his native land. This was granted, and he
left Naples in a galley called <i>El Sol</i> with letters from
Don John to the King, in which he was strongly recommended
as “a man of valor, of merit, and of many
signal services.” But on the voyage a terrible calamity
befell him, which was to be the greatest of all his
adventures and the severest of all his trials. Just
as he was rejoicing at the sight of the Spanish coast,
a squadron of corsairs, or pirates, under a redoubtable
captain who was the terror of the Mediterranean,
bore down on <i>El Sol</i>. A desperate fight followed,
but the pirate galleys were too strong. A number of
Spaniards were captured, and Cervantes found himself
carried off to Africa and placed at the mercy of
a savage Greek who was noted for his wild ferocity.
As letters were found on him from Don John of Austria,
he was considered a prize of considerable value,
for whom a large ransom might be demanded. Ac<span class="pagenum">85</span>cordingly
he was sent to Algiers heavily chained,
and was treated there with the greatest severity.</p>

<p>During his captivity, which lasted as long as five
years, Cervantes showed the most splendid courage;
adversity, indeed, brought out the finest qualities in
his character. He persistently organized plans of escape,
the failure of one never deterring him from preparing
another. On the first occasion his project was
defeated by a Moor, who was engaged as a guide but
deserted at the last moment, and the party of fugitives
were obliged to return to Algiers, where Cervantes
was severely punished. The next year a sum
of money was sent over by his parents, but was not
sufficient for his ransom. His brother Rodrigo, who
was one of the prisoners, was, however, set free, and
went home to Spain with a request that a war vessel
should be despatched to Algiers to rescue the others.
Cervantes in the meantime made all the necessary
arrangements for escape. He concealed about fifty of
the Spanish fugitives in a cave outside the town, and
actually managed to have them supplied with food
for six months. It was a long time to wait, but at
last the day came when the ship was expected, and
he and his comrades were in readiness. But, as bad
luck would have it, a traitor betrayed them at the
critical moment and their secret got out. A force
of armed Turks discovered and captured them. Cervantes
immediately took upon himself the whole blame
and declared that he alone was responsible. Though<span class="pagenum">86</span>
threatened with torture and even death, he refused
to implicate any one of his companions in the scheme
of flight. The cruel Turkish Governor, Hassan Pasha,
before whom he was brought did not as a rule hesitate
to hang, impale, or mutilate his prisoners. But in
this case he appears to have been overawed by the
astounding fearlessness of the remarkable Spaniard
who was brought before him.</p>

<p>While in captivity Cervantes addressed a rhymed
letter to the King’s secretary describing the sufferings
of himself and his companions and appealing for help
from Spain. Although nothing came of this, the undaunted
hero set about devising a new plan of escape,
which yet again was destined to be frustrated. This
time his messenger was caught and ordered to be impaled,
while he himself was condemned to receive two
thousand blows with a stick; this latter sentence, fortunately,
was never carried out. Notwithstanding repeated
failure and the dangerous risks he ran, Cervantes
on the first opportunity hatched another plot.</p>

<p>Two merchants agreed to provide an armed vessel
in which sixty of the principal captives were to embark.
A Spanish monk called Blanco de Paz, who
seems for some unknown motive to have conceived
a deadly hatred for Cervantes, revealed the scheme
before it could be carried out. In spite of this, however,
the adventurous captive might easily have escaped
from the terrible life to which he was doomed
had he consented to the proposal of the merchants<span class="pagenum">87</span>
to go away alone. But he firmly refused to abandon
his companions in their distress, and in order that
none of his friends might suffer, he came forward
once more and gave himself up to the Governor. He
was bound and led with a rope round his neck before
Hassan. As usual, he displayed no fear, although
this time he fully expected that he would be hanged
or impaled, or at least have his nose and ears cut off
by the Governor’s orders. But for some mysterious
reason—probably the hope that a very high price
would be offered for so remarkable a man—nothing
worse than five months’ close confinement in chains
was meted out to him. Hassan declared that so long
as he had the maimed Spaniard in safe keeping his
Christians, ships, and city were secure.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in Spain more active steps were taken
to collect sufficient money for his ransom. His father
had died, but his mother and sister managed to raise
a considerable sum, and money came in from other
sources. Messengers were despatched to Africa, and
after a long dispute over the bargain with the Turkish
Pasha, Cervantes, who had actually embarked on a
ship bound for Constantinople, was at last set at
liberty.</p>

<p>It is not from the boasting of Cervantes himself
that we have the particulars of his behavior during
these five years of captivity. Blanco de Paz circulated
malicious reports about him, and this led to an
investigation. It is, therefore, on the authority of his<span class="pagenum">88</span>
fellow-captives that the story comes down to us. They
witnessed to his good-temper and cheerfulness, for he
had an overpowering sense of humor which must have
saved his companions from depression and despair;
they tell of his courage in danger, his resolution under
suffering, his patience in trouble, and his daring and
cleverness in action.</p>

<p>Had he lived in the days of newspapers, the fame
of his exploits would have been proclaimed to all the
world. He would have been petted and spoilt as a
hero, and all the empty flattery and cheap advertisement
which is heaped on any one in our day who
appeals for the moment to the popular imagination
would have been loaded upon him without stint. As
it was, he arrived to find his family impoverished and
in trouble, his patron, Don John of Austria, dead,
and no one to say a good word for him in high quarters.
He had been away ten years and was now only
thirty-three.</p>

<p>In 1580, the year of Cervantes’ return to his native
land, Spain was at the very height of her power.
Philip II ruled not only over Spain but over Portugal
and the Netherlands: more than half Italy belonged
to him, as well as Oran and a considerable
territory on the African shore of the Mediterranean,
and in addition all that was European in Southern
Asia. In the New World, from Chile to Florida,
three-quarters of the known continent came under his
rule.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">89</span></p>

<p>By sea and by land Spain was predominant and
was the envy and admiration of her neighbors. But
with all this greatness, which was only the greatness
of size, decay was present in the heart of the Empire.
Under Philip, the rot spread further.</p>

<p>Lust for gold, which poured into the country from
her rich colonies, and rage for dominion absorbed
every wholesome passion in Spain, and gradually she
fell away from her position of domination. It is one
of the many instances which show how Imperial ambition
and the worship of force can bring about a
country’s ruin. Men begin to boast about the number
of square miles and the number of million souls
that come under their flag. Their minds become occupied
with material ends: the Government pursues a
policy of aggression and aggrandizement: and the
urgent needs of improvement in the social and economic
condition of the common people are neglected.
To wring as much as possible from the people at
home and to acquire as much secret influence as possible
in the affairs of other nations was the rule of
Philip’s conduct and the object of his life.</p>

<p>There were wars without number, and Cervantes
seems to have found a fresh opportunity of serving
his country as a soldier in Portugal, but the evidence
for this is doubtful. But, what is more important,
he now became more active with his pen, and wrote
a number of poems and plays. The most famous of
these was “Galatea,” a poetical romance which<span class="pagenum">90</span>
brought him to the front. Nevertheless, he found he
could not get enough money by writing to keep his
home—in fact, to the end, his life was a perpetual
struggle with poverty.</p>

<p>At the age of thirty-seven he married a lady who
rejoiced in the high-sounding name of Doña Catalina
de Palacios Salazan y Vezmediano. Hardly anything
is known of her, except the dowry which she brought
with her, which consisted amongst other things of
plantations of vines, household furniture, two linen
sheets, three of cotton, a cushion stuffed with wool,
one good blanket and one worn, garments, four beehives,
forty-live hens and pullets and one cock. Her
neighbors considered that so rich a young woman was
throwing herself away on the obscure maimed soldier
who was many years her senior. She survived
her husband by ten years.</p>

<p>Cervantes began now to work at his writing very
seriously, but he was quite unable to compete with
the principal Spanish dramatist of the time, Lope
de Vega, who was a great popular favorite, and,
though the younger of the two, outstripped his rival
easily in his powers of production, which were prodigious.
But he was known as “the universal envier”
of the applause given to others. In his lifetime Lope
is said to have written one thousand eight hundred
plays, not to mention innumerable poems and stories.
He was a dissolute character, with great energy,
boundless invention, and considerable wit. But few<span class="pagenum">91</span>
of his plays have survived, and outside Spain the
name of Lope de Vega is but little known to-day.
The Spanish drama of this period was the model
copied by other countries. The bustling farce originated
in Spain, and Elizabethan and Jacobean writers
took many of the plots for their plays from Spanish
dramatists.</p>

<p>But Cervantes could not make a living out of writing;
unlike Lope, he had no powerful and influential
friends. He had therefore to look for other employment.
The Invincible Armada was just then being
fitted up, and he got a post as agent for collecting
provisions, and afterwards he was appointed to the
very humble position of tax-collector—an occupation
he must have hated, as he got into trouble more than
once, having to pay the debts of people whom he had
trusted too much. He applied for a higher post in
the Government service, but his petition was dismissed
and he was forced to continue the distasteful
work at a reduced salary, falling into such extreme
poverty at one time that he actually was in need of
common cloth to cover his nakedness. His unbusinesslike
habits made people suspect his honesty. He
drifted lower and lower, until at last he was imprisoned
in Seville for mistakes in his accounts. From
the court he could expect nothing. Philip was not
likely to be sympathetic to a struggling writer or
even grateful to an old soldier, and prayers from Cervantes
were set aside unanswered. Nor when Philip’s<span class="pagenum">92</span>
son, Philip III, succeeded to the throne did any crumb
of royal favor fall his way.</p>

<p>In the face of all these disadvantages and troubles
the great work of his genius was being conceived and
written, and in 1605 the first part of “Don Quixote”
appeared. Although it was an immediate success with
the people, the Church of course expressed strong
disapproval, and literary men criticized it, Lope de
Vega wrote: “No poet is as bad as Cervantes nor so
foolish as to praise ‘Don Quixote.’”</p>

<p>The books people read most of all in those days
were romances of chivalry, recording absurd adventures
of wonderful knights-errant who wandered about
capturing princesses from castles and performing
great deeds of prowess—all written quite seriously.
Cervantes wanted to ridicule this sort of literature
and show up its absurdity. But so fertile was his
imagination and so varied had been his own experiences
that at the same time, as I have already said,
he succeeded in giving a wonderfully graphic picture
of Spanish life, bringing in all classes of society and
also recording many of his own adventures as a
soldier.</p>

<p>Don Quixote himself, though a ridiculous figure in
a way, is depicted as a delightful gentleman filled with
generous and high-minded sentiments, courteous and
kindly, a champion of the downtrodden, and a protector
of the weak. The word “quixotic,” which is<span class="pagenum">93</span>
used in every language in the civilized world, conveys
precisely the knight’s character. It means a man
with impossibly extravagant romantic and chivalrous
notions, but a man with high ambitions who is a
champion and reformer at heart. The book was not
the work of a learned scholar or professor; it was
the outcome of natural genius which appealed directly
to all classes and all ages. The saying at the time
was that “Children turn its leaves, young people read
it, grown men understand it, old folks praise it.” The
English were among the first to appreciate the wonderful
book of adventures and it was translated in
1612.</p>

<p>About the second part of “Don Quixote” there
is a curious story. While Cervantes was at work
at it, some one who called himself Avellaneda (some
think it was his old enemy, Blanco de Paz) wrote
and published a second part, which was a sort of
imitation rather cleverly done, but, of course, without
any of the merits of the original. It contains an
ill-natured prologue referring to the author of the
first part as a cripple, a backbiter, a malefactor, and
a jailbird, and reproaching him for having more
tongue than hands (a reference to his maimed left
hand). Cervantes was naturally indignant at this
attempt to spoil his book. He hastened to issue his
own second part, and thus completed his great work,
which, throughout, is of the same high quality. It<span class="pagenum">94</span>
is possible that had it not been for the intrusion of
this impertinent interloper the second part of “Don
Quixote” might never have been finished.</p>

<p>The whole book was written at a time when the
poor unfortunate author was struggling sometimes
actually for bread. But nowhere in it can be found
any trace of malice or bitterness. The second part
was finished as he was approaching the seventieth year
of a life of toil, privation, and disappointment. But
his unfailing cheerfulness and good-humor never left
him. This is very remarkable, because so many authors
who have written satire have been unable to
resist spiteful digs at other people.</p>

<p>It is a great pity there is no proper portrait of
Cervantes. Velasquez, the greatest Spanish painter,
lived just a little too late, but his master and father-in-law,
Pacheco, painted a picture representing the
release of captives from Algiers, and a boatman in
that picture is supposed to represent Cervantes. There
is also a doubtful portrait by a painter called Jaurequi.
But many portraits came out, one of which
is reproduced here, which were made up from his
own description of himself:</p>



<p class="small">He whom you see here of aquiline features with chestnut
hair, a smooth, unruffled forehead, with sparkling
eyes and a nose arched though well proportioned—a beard
of silver which not twenty years since was of gold—great
mustaches, a small mouth, the teeth of no account, for
<span class="pagenum">95</span>
he has but six of them, and they in bad condition and
worse arranged, for they do not hold correspondence with
one another; the body between two extremes, neither
great nor little; the complexion bright, rather white than
brown; somewhat heavy in the shoulders—this, I say, is
the aspect of the author of “Don Quixote de la Mancha.”</p>

<p>He also tells us he had an infirmity of speech and
was nearsighted.</p>

<p>The Archbishop of Toledo, who was one of the
few people who befriended him, was once questioned
by some French visitors about him. “I found myself
compelled to say,” he confesses, “that he was an
old man, a soldier, a gentleman, and poor.” “If it is
necessity that compels him to write,” replied one of the
strangers, “may God send he may never have abundance,
so that, poor himself, he may make the whole
world rich.”</p>

<p>Cervantes lived for some years in a very poor part
of Valladolid. The family, consisting of his wife, his
daughter, his sister, a niece, and a cousin, were more
or less dependent on him, though the women by their
needlework helped to keep the household going. The
sidelights cast by scraps of evidence which have been
collected about members of his family do not give at
all an attractive impression of his domestic life. It
was altogether rather squalid and wretched: he lived
cooped up in hugger-mugger fashion, doing odds and
ends of work for business men into whose characters<span class="pagenum">96</span>
he could not afford to pry too curiously. But Cervantes’
mind was in no way poisoned by his surroundings.</p>

<p>Even if “Don Quixote” had never been written,
the stories called “Novelas Examplares” would have
entitled Cervantes to the foremost place among Spanish
novelists.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott admired them greatly, and declared
that they had first inspired him with the ambition
of excelling in fiction. Cervantes went on writing
to the very end of his life. An anecdote he tells
in one of his last writings shows the sort of cheerful
way in which he looked upon failing health, old age,
and death. He relates how a student overtook him
as a companion on the road one day, and hearing the
name of Miguel de Cervantes, at once alighted from
his ass and (to put it in his own words)—</p>



<p class="small">made for me and hastily seized me by the left hand, cried
“Yes, yes; it is he of the crippled hand, sure enough, the
all-famous, the merry writer, and indeed the joy of the
Muses!” To me, who in these brief terms saw of my praises
the grand compass, it seemed to be discourteous not to respond
to them, so, embracing him round the neck, whereby
I made entire havoc of his collar, I said: “This is a mistake
in which many friends from ignorance have fallen.
I, sir, am Cervantes; but not the joy of the Muses, nor
any of the fine things your worship has said. Regain your
ass and mount, and let us travel together in pleasant talk
for the rest of our short journey.” The polite student did
so, we reduced our speed a little, and at a leisurely pace
<span class="pagenum">97</span>
pursued our journey, in the course of which my infirmity
was touched upon. The good student checked my mirth
in a moment: “This malady is the dropsy, which not all
the water of the ocean, let it be ever so sweet drinking,
can cure. Let your worship set bounds to your drink,
not forgetting to eat, for so without other medicine you
will do well.” “That many have told me,” answered I.
“but I can no more give up drinking for pleasure than
I had been born for nothing else. My life is slipping
away, and by the diary my pulse is keeping, which at the
latest will end its reckoning this coming Sunday, I have
to close my life’s account. Your worship has come to
know me in a rude moment, since there is no time for
me to show my gratitude for the good-will you have
shown me.”</p>

<p>He ends his narrative with the words:</p>

<p class="small">Good-by, humors; good-by, pleasant fancies; good-by,
merry friends; for I perceive I am dying, in the wish to
see you happy in the other life.</p>

<p>Cervantes died on April 19, 1616, at Madrid, and
was buried without any ceremony. No stone or inscription
even marked his grave. When, thirty years
later, Lope de Vega died, grandees bore his coffin and
bishops officiated at the funeral ceremonies, which
lasted nine days.</p>

<p>Look out for people about whom a tremendous fuss
is made, and remember that loud applause is not
necessarily the accompaniment of real merit.</p>

<p>No wise man expects to get immediate credit for
his achievements. He does not work for personal re<span class="pagenum">98</span>nown,
but for the love of his art or the attainment of
his ideals. Fame is cheaply won by many who little
deserve it. But to leave so rich a legacy to mankind
as Cervantes did, and a name so highly honored for
all time, is the privilege of very few.</p>

GIORDANO BRUNO<br /><br />

1548–1600</h2>


<p><small>I have fought: that is much—victory is in the hands of fate. Be
that as it may with me, this at least future ages will not deny of
me, be the victor who may—that I did not fear to die, yielded to
none of my fellows in constancy, and preferred a spirited death
to a cowardly life.</small><br /><br /></p>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the world grows older knowledge increases.
From time to time men have to correct and alter
their opinions and beliefs. What at one period is
accepted as true may be proved at a later period to
be false. But we do not like abandoning our favorite
beliefs, and we are apt to get rather annoyed with a
reformer, a discoverer, or an inventor who comes along
with new notions and upsets our ideas. Even to-day
such a man is often laughed at or abused. In mediæval
times he was made to suffer as an outcast and
even sometimes as a criminal.</p>

<p>You will read many books about heroes who have
displayed courage and endurance in battle, exploration,
and adventure. But men who have had to overcome
prejudices and to stand by their opinions in
spite of almost universal opposition have also played<span class="pagenum">100</span>
an important part in the world’s history, though you
may hear less about them. Moral courage is more
rare than physical courage. To display physical courage
may make a man a popular hero. If he fails he
is stamped as a coward. To display moral courage
more often than not makes a man unpopular. There
is no audience to applaud and it is quite easy to be
a moral coward without any one, even intimate
friends, finding it out. It is far simpler to say “Yes”
when every one else is saying “Yes.” He who rows
against the stream cannot hope to carry many with
him, and his progress must be slow.</p>

<p>Nothing can have upset men’s calculations more
than the first great discoveries of astronomy. No
doubt people scoffed when Pythagoras told them the
earth was round and not flat, as they supposed. But
it was a still more disturbing idea to be told that the
earth was not the center of the universe, with the
sun and moon and stars revolving round it. Most
men firmly believed this to be the case up to the fifteenth
century. And when Copernicus first elaborated
in a book, between 1506 and 1512, the heliocentric theory,
that is to say the theory that the sun was the
center round which the earth and the other planets
revolved, it was a long time before any one would
treat such an idea seriously. We may laugh at the
ignorance of our forefathers, and we may declare
glibly that of course the earth goes round the sun,
but there are not many of us who would be ready to
<span class="pagenum">101</span>explain scientifically why we know this to be a fact.
We, too, have to accept a great deal on other people’s
authority because <i>we are told</i> it is true, and not because
<i>we know</i> it is true. And to us again the new
idea often appears unwelcome and disturbs our most
cherished beliefs.</p>

<p>But, anyhow, we know now that a man’s deeds and
his loyalty to his own convictions are far more important
than any declaration he may make of his beliefs,
especially when such a declaration is forced
from him or made to please others. Some people find
it very difficult to believe things of which they cannot
see the clear explanation. Other people, with very
little effort, can believe almost anything they are told.
They are like the White Queen in “Alice Through the
Looking Glass,” who, when Alice said she could not
believe impossible things, replied, “I dare say you
haven’t had much practice. When I was your age
I always did it for half an hour a day. Why, sometimes
I believed as many as six impossible things before
breakfast.”</p>

<p>In the sixteenth century doubt and disbelief in any
of the hard-and-fast rules and dogmas of the Church
was not tolerated. Any one who was bold enough to
refuse to say he believed what he conscientiously knew
he could not believe was liable to be punished with
the utmost severity.</p>

<p class="tb">In the Campo dei Fiori, the largest open space in<span class="pagenum">102</span>
Rome, a vast concourse of people assembled on February
17th in the year 1600. In the center of the
place stood a huge pile of faggots: from the midst
of its logs and branches there rose a stake. On many
of the eager and expectant faces which crowded round
might have been seen an expression of malignant triumph.
The Church was taking revenge on a heretic
who had refused to accept all the doctrines laid down
by its authority, a heretic who actually taught that
the earth moved round the sun.</p>

<p>Soldiers clear the way for the procession which
advances solemnly to the spot. A small, thin man
with a black beard, clothed in the garb of a condemned
victim of the Inquisition—a sulphur-colored cloak
painted with flames and devils—is led up to the pile.
The priests even now, at the last moment, argue with
him and attempt to make him acknowledge his error.
With a look of melancholy but unconquerable determination
he refuses to listen to them or to receive
any consolation from them. A jeer rises from the
multitude. He is taken and chained to the stake.
Will he not at the last moment recant? Will he not
utter the words that will save him from such cruel
torture? Will he not pray for mercy? They wait a
moment, but he remains silent, calm, and obdurate.
The faggots are lit, the branches crackle; flames leap
up; the victim writhes, but not a single cry escapes
him. Amid frantic shouts from the crowd the smoke
envelops him. In a few moments all that remains is<span class="pagenum">103</span>
a pile of ashes, which are scattered to the winds....
This was the end of Giordano Bruno, the Italian philosopher
and poet, who refused to consent to what he
thought was false and refused to deny what he thought
was true.</p>

<p class="tb">It has been said that men resemble the earth which
bears them. The volcanic slope of Mount Vesuvius
was the birthplace of this fiery and unconquerable
fighter. He was born in 1548 at Nola, and was the
son of a soldier. Not only does he seem in his early
youth to have had a great love of learning, but he
was able to get the very best tuition in Naples, where
he lodged with an uncle who was a weaver of velvet.
His knowledge of science, mathematics, and the
classics, as well as of poetry and music, was astonishing
even when he was quite young. Besides Italian,
he spoke Latin and Spanish fluently and knew
something of Greek. In spite of his ardent nature,
his first step was to shut himself up as a Dominican
monk at the age of fourteen. He remained for thirteen
years in monastic seclusion, and was duly promoted
to holy orders and to the priesthood. He pursued
his studies all this time with the greatest diligence.
He laid in stores of learning which were the
foundation of his independent views and writings in
after-life. But it was impossible that a man of
such fire and energy should tamely settle down to a
quiet life of prayer and contemplation. The Church<span class="pagenum">104</span>
was in a pitiable state of ignorance and corruption.
Young Giordano’s keen intelligence, strengthened by
study and roused by his restless energy, soon drove
him into conflict with his superiors. This was the
first of a series of conflicts in which he combated the
forces of authority wherever he went all his life
through. He was accused of impiety because of the
broad views he expressed about some of the principal
doctrines of the Church. His position became intolerable,
so he cast off his monkish robe and fled to
Genoese territory, where he remained a few months
supporting himself by teaching grammar to boys and
occupying his leisure in reading astronomy. In this
latter science he at once accepted the views of Copernicus.
“The earth,” he said, “moves; it turns on
its own axis and moves round the sun.” But what is
now taught to every school child was thought then a
dangerous doctrine, contrary to the teaching of Aristotle,
which the Church supported. He also went
further than any of his predecessors in suggesting
that there were other worlds which were inhabited.
The revival of learning which had been going on during
the previous hundred years, while it had encouraged
the more educated and cultured few to pursue
their studies and think out new ideas, had also had
the effect of making the many who mistrusted reform
and were frightened of change much more particular
and severe about the opinions and beliefs which men
should be allowed to hold. The new ideas ultimately<span class="pagenum">105</span>
prevailed, but only after a desperate struggle. Had
the school of thought which Bruno represented been
allowed to develop without hindrance, the advance of
enlightenment in Europe would have been far more
rapid than was actually the case.</p>

<p>Giordano Bruno wandered over Europe alone like
a knight-errant of truth. Persecuted in one country,
he fled to another, everywhere stirring up dispute and
controversy, urging men to <i>think</i>, and denouncing the
fanatical and pretended beliefs which were making
them thoughtless and cruel. Geneva, Lyons, Paris,
London, Oxford, Wittenberg, Helmstedt, and Venice—these
were some of the places he visited, the centers
of the world’s active thought, where he could meet the
leading men of the day.</p>

<p>Now, we cannot enter into the very difficult question
of religious belief as it was understood in those
days. Nor, indeed, would such a study be very profitable
to any one. The wrangling of theologians has
very little to do with true religion. Bruno knew this.
While he was opposed to the Roman Catholic Church,
of which he had been accepted as a member in his
youth, he hated just as much at the other extreme
the narrow intolerance of the followers of Calvin,
the French Reformers, who also treated those who
disagreed with them with great harshness and cruelty.
Besides, there was almost as much stupid wrangling
and brutal intolerance between Calvinists and Lutherans
as there was between Catholics and Protestants.<span class="pagenum">106</span>
Bruno therefore did not stay long in Geneva, which
was the headquarters of the Calvinists. Even in Wittenberg,
where he was very well received, while admiring
the attitude of the great Reformer Luther,
who a few years before had been the foremost figure
in the great struggle with the Roman Catholic Church,
known as the Reformation, he by no means sympathized
with the teaching of Protestantism. On the
contrary, he referred to the German Reformers, when
he was before the Inquisition in Venice, in the following
way: “I regard them as more ignorant than I
am; I despise them and their doctrine. They do not
deserve the name of theologians but of pedants.”</p>

<p>Before we follow the wandering philosopher on his
travels, let us try to understand a little of what he
thought himself. He was not, as he was accused of
being, just a blasphemous atheist who went about
offending the religious feelings of all with whom he
came in contact. He was not a rude, untutored sceptic
or disbeliever who shocked people by laughing at
their beliefs. He did not merely indulge in abuse and
spiteful criticism. Though this is the view which
was spread about him by many of his contemporaries
and taught about him for many years after his death,
nothing could be further from the truth. Giordano
Bruno was extremely spiritual-minded. So far was
he from being an atheist (which would have been just
as narrow and dogmatic a point of view as that of
any of the other extremes), he saw God everywhere<span class="pagenum">107</span>
and in everything, and his vision extended to the whole
universe. He saw the essence of Divine perfection in
man, but deplored the many causes which prevented
it from showing itself. He wanted the mind of man
to be free, and not fettered by all sorts of elaborate
creeds and regulations. This freedom he demanded
for himself, and he insisted that all questions should
be considered as open. What he detested most were
the disputes about religion of the various sects, the
bitter and angry spirit they produced, and the ruthless
persecutions carried on by religious bodies on
all sides. Through freedom and enlightenment alone
he saw that mankind could progress, and not through
submission and ignorance. But all this was quite unintelligible
to the vast majority, who took the narrow
and bigoted views on religion which were common
in those days. He was not a mere student of
books, nor was he content with thoughts alone on
the great problems of religion and philosophy: he
taught, he wrote, he lectured, he spoke with such lively
eloquence and striking persuasiveness, and sometimes
with such violence of language, that it was impossible
to ignore him. His views were fascinating by their
novelty and boldness, but he entirely lacked caution
and prudence. In these circumstances it is not surprising
that he was excommunicated from the Church,
expelled from universities, and driven out of the towns
he visited.</p>

<p>For sixteen years he wandered about Europe at a<span class="pagenum">108</span>
time when to travel meant spending eight days on the
road from Paris to Calais: he had to put up in inns
with very rough fare and sometimes only a bed of
straw. Books were now printed, but they still circulated
very slowly, and the fame of a professor was
made more by “disputation,” that is to say, lecture
and debate, than by the publication of his writings.
Nevertheless, the wandering Italian published several
books in every town he visited. With the exception
of a few that have been lost, most of his philosophical
writings and poems have been collected together and
preserved.</p>

<p>Bruno found France torn by internal quarrels between
the Protestant Huguenots and the Roman Catholics,
which had been going on for some years in the
shape of a destructive civil war. Only eight years
before, in 1572, there had been a wholesale massacre
of Protestants in Paris on St. Bartholomew’s Eve,
when Charles IX was king. All this served to show
Bruno to what excesses men could be driven in religious
strife. After a visit to Toulouse, where he taught
astronomy and philosophy, he proceeded to Paris.
Here, although he refused to attend Mass, he managed
to become a professor, chiefly by the favor of
King Henry III, who, however, required to be satisfied
first of all that Bruno’s wonderful memory came
“by knowledge and not by magic arts.” In gratitude
for these favors the philosopher referred to the King
in his writings with exaggerated praise. It was in<span class="pagenum">109</span>deed
one of the charges against him, when he came
to his trial in Venice, that he had praised the heretic
prince, the news of whose assassination in 1589 was
received in Rome with a salute of cannon.</p>

<p>Bruno’s method of lecturing must have been very
startling to those who were accustomed to the grave
airs of the learned professors. He was enthusiastic
and eloquent, and so eager that his hearers should
grasp his meaning that he would adopt every sort
of different manner of addressing them. Sometimes
grave and prophet-like, at other times lively and gay:
sometimes fierce and combative, and then, again, indulging
in gross buffoonery. He was bent on attracting
attention and rousing the indifference of his audiences.
In his writings, too, he showed varying moods.
The wit, the scoffer, the poet, the mystic, and the
prophet all appear. Great as his learning was, he
depended more on his intuitions; that is to say, the
imaginative poet in him was stronger than the scientific
scholar. But some of the wisest philosophers
in after-years owed a great deal to his wonderfully
far-reaching thoughts and ideas.</p>

<p>In 1583 he went to London with letters furnished
by the King of France to his Ambassador. He found
Queen Elizabeth very sympathetic. A friendly welcome
was extended by her court to all foreigners, and
she herself spoke Italian fluently. He was also fortunate
in having a cultured and liberal-minded patron
in the Ambassador, M. Castelnau de Mauvissière, who<span class="pagenum">110</span>
was endeavoring to negotiate a marriage between
Queen Elizabeth and the Duke of Anjou. Bruno, who
was excused from attending Mass in the Embassy
chapel, was no doubt grateful for the considerate
way in which he was treated, for several books produced
by him during his stay in England were dedicated
to the Ambassador. He also alludes to the Ambassador’s
wife with respectful praise, and remarks
enthusiastically about his little daughter: “Her perfected
goodness makes one marvel whether she be
flown from heaven or be a creature of this common
earth.”</p>

<p>London had only a hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants
in those days, and was not such an important
place as Paris or even Lisbon. Foreign visitors
were not well received as a rule by the people, and
English students seldom traveled abroad. Though the
Queen prided herself on her learning, very little education
and no freedom of discussion were allowed
among her humbler subjects. Printers were only licensed
in London, Oxford, and Cambridge, and every
publication was rigorously examined. Without his introduction
to the court, Bruno would probably have
been silenced after a very short time. As it was, in
England no more than elsewhere could the philosopher
take things quietly, though he very much appreciated
the comparative liberty of thought and speech
he was allowed. He had no sooner arrived in London
than he sent to Oxford University a challenge which<span class="pagenum">111</span>
he appropriately called “The Awakener.” With a
loud flourish of trumpets, he described himself as:</p>



<p class="small">a doctor in perfected theology; a professor of pure and
blameless wisdom; a philosopher known, approved, and
honorifically acknowledged by the foremost academies of
Europe; to none a stranger except to the barbarians and
the vulgar; a waker of slumbering souls; a breaker of
presumptuous and stubborn ignorance.</p>

<p>Both to the Sorbonne in Paris and the Wittenberg
University he addressed himself in much more dignified
and modest language. He evidently did not take
Oxford very seriously, and indeed there was very little
intellectual life in that University, which was
under the rule of the Queen’s favorite, Lord Leicester.
The professors were court nominees, and Bruno
describes them as “men arrayed in long robes of velvet,
with hands most precious for the multitude of
costly rings on their fingers, golden chains about their
necks, and with manners as void of courtesy as cowherds.”
He also thought they knew a good deal more
of beer than of Greek. The students were very young,
ignorant, and boorish, occupied in drinking, dueling,
and toasting in ale-houses and country inns. However,
he had a very high opinion of the University as
a whole, and consented to deliver a series of lectures
and also held a public disputation before the Chancellor
and an illustrious foreign visitor. He appears
to have aroused the pedagogues to fury, and, by his<span class="pagenum">112</span>
own account, fifteen times he worsted his chief adversary,
who could only reply by abuse. He stood up
in the assembly a small man, “rough hewn,” with disheveled
hair, wearing an old coat with several
buttons wanting, while the Oxford doctors, whose opposition
he describes as based on “ignorance, presumption,
and rustic rudeness,” wore “twelve rings on
two fingers and two chains of shining gold.” While
they were attempting to defend the old teaching of
Aristotle from the attacks of a man they regarded as
an eccentric charlatan, he explained his new ideas,
which were to them startling and highly objectionable.</p>

<p>Small wonder that after three months his public
lectures were brought to an end and he returned to
London. Here he made several friends, among them
Sir Philip Sidney, the poet-soldier, of whom he had
already heard in Italy, for Sidney had studied at
Padua. Fulk Greville, who described himself on his
epitaph as “Servant to Queen Elizabeth, Councilor
to King James, and friend to Sir Philip Sidney,” also
became intimate with him, and at his house Bruno
held a second disputation, at which he again seems
to have aggravated his hearers. He had a sincere admiration
for Sidney and dedicated a book of sonnets
to him. The protection given to him by Queen Elizabeth
he repaid by referring to her in his poems in
terms of the highest flattery, which no doubt she
appreciated. But this praise of a Protestant Queen,
who herself was excommunicated, was eventually<span class="pagenum">113</span>
brought against him by his judges. He was greatly
impressed by the beauty and bearing of English
women and by “the Briton’s terrible energy, who, regardless
of the stormy deep and the towering mountains,
goes down to the sea in ships mightily exceeding
Argonautic art.” After two years in England he
returned to Paris with the French Ambassador, who,
he says, “saved him from the Oxford pedants and
from hunger.” But he did not stay long in Paris,
“because of the tumults,” and proceeded on his wanderings
into Germany.</p>

<p>At Marburg, the rector of the University refused
Bruno permission to hold public disputations on philosophy,
at which, the rector himself says, “he fell
into a passion of anger and he insulted me in my
house.” No doubt he made it very unpleasant for
any one who attempted to thwart him, for he was
headstrong and impetuous. At Wittenberg he was
permitted to enter his name on the lists of the University,
and also to give private lectures. The professors
of Toulouse, Paris, and Oxford, he declared,
received him “with grimaces, upturned noses, puffed
cheeks, and with loud blows on the desk,” but the
learned men of Wittenberg showed him courtesy and
left him in peace. In fact, he was able to remain
there working for two years, until, owing to the feud
between the Lutherans and the Calvinists, in which
the latter got the upper hand, he found himself compelled
to quit the city. On his departure he pro<span class="pagenum">114</span>nounced
a great oration in praise of wisdom, which
malicious public opinion described as a speech in favor
of the devil.</p>

<p>His next halt was at Prague, where he was received
by the Emperor Rudolph II, the patron of Tycho
Brahe and Kepler, and a student of philosophy and
astronomy as well as of magic and astrology. The
Italian philosopher addressed a small work to His
Majesty, in which he repeats that his mission is to
free the souls of men and to triumph over ignorance:
he laments the hateful quarreling of different creeds,
and proclaims charity and love to be the only true
religion. As he did not meet with sympathy or support
in Prague, he passed on to Helmstedt, where the
Duke of Brunswick charged him with the education
of his son. But here again he got at cross-purposes
with the authorities, and this brought down on him
a sentence of excommunication. He justified himself,
and wrote a scathing attack on the pastor and rector
of the University, who were his chief enemies. But
it was not possible for him to remain, so he turned his
steps toward Frankfort. This town was the center
of the German book trade: fairs were held at Easter
and Michaelmas, and people came from other countries
to try and exchange books, which were still
very rare. Bruno published several books here, and
one might think he would have been left to pursue his
studies without interference. But the burgomaster,
or mayor, sternly refused to allow him to lodge with<span class="pagenum">115</span>
his printer. A convent of Carmelites therefore gave
him shelter, and there he is said to have been “busied
with writing for the most part all day long, or in going
to and fro indulging in subtle inquiries, wrapt
in thought and filled with fantastic meditations upon
new things.”</p>

<p>It is very curious that Giordano Bruno should ever
have been persuaded to return to Italy. But he seems
not to have thought it impossible that he could become
reconciled to the Church while retaining for
himself a certain freedom of thought. No doubt he
was also tempted to return by his love of his native
land. Yet he must have had a foreboding of the danger
he was running when he wrote, on leaving Frankfort:
“The wise man fears not death; nay, even there
are times when he sets forth to meet it bravely.”</p>

<p>Bruno now made the acquaintance of the traitor by
whose falseness he was eventually to be handed over
to a cruel fate. Giovanni Mocenigo was a member of
one of the foremost Venetian families. But the wisdom
of his ancestors, seven of whom had been Doges—that
is, chief magistrates—of Venice, had degenerated
in him into cunning. He came across Bruno’s books,
and out of curiosity, believing that there was something
occult and supernatural about Bruno’s teaching,
he invited him to come and stay with him in Venice.
The philosopher innocently accepted the invitation.
His reputation as a man of lively conversation
preceded him, and he found himself cordially received<span class="pagenum">116</span>
in Venetian literary society. But very soon Mocenigo
began to grow discontented with his master. He was
quite unable to understand his teaching or to profit
in the smallest degree by the Art of Memory, which
was one of Bruno’s favorite principles of instruction.
In fact, the two were completely out of sympathy,
and the patron began to insist that he got no return
for his generous hospitality. Bruno at first tried to
reason with him, but finding him hopelessly dense and
narrow-minded, became exasperated and begged he
might be set at liberty to return to Frankfort. Mocenigo
then determined to betray him because of his
religious opinions. He consulted his confessor, and
then denounced his unfortunate guest to the Father
Inquisitor at Venice as a wicked and irreligious man.
Accompanied by his servant and five or six gondoliers,
he burst in upon Bruno while he was in bed and
dragged him to a garret, where he locked him up.
The trial took place in 1592. The charges brought
against Giordano Bruno were that he had criticized
the methods of the Church, desired and foretold its
reform, disputed its doctrines, consorted with heretics,
and taught principles which were repugnant to
Catholics. The culprit gave a complete account of
his life; he said he was sorry if he had done what was
wrong or taught what was false, and was ready to
atone for any scandal he had given in the past, but
he did not retract a single one of his convictions.</p>

<p>It may be well here just to say a word about the<span class="pagenum">117</span>
Inquisition, which has been so often mentioned and
figures so prominently in the history of these times.</p>

<p>The Holy Office, as it was first called, was instituted
early in the thirteenth century. Its practical founder
was a Spanish monk, Domenigo de Guzman, who afterwards
was known as St. Dominic. The Popes at first
regarded the institution with disapproval, as it was
set up as a quite independent body, and bishops even
were not allowed to interfere with its proceedings.
Towards the end of the fifteenth century it was re-established
on a far more active basis under the Grand
Inquisitor Torquemada, who organized the most fiendish
cruelties for which any human being has ever been
responsible. The object of the Inquisition was to suppress
heresy, that is to say, either force people into
the Romish Church or, should they refuse, kill them
or make their lives intolerable. The mildest form of
punishment was called public penitence, which meant
being made an outcast in society, closely watched by
the ecclesiastical authorities, and heavily fined. Tortures
of indescribable kinds were used; people were imprisoned
for life or burned alive, though sometimes
as a favor they might be strangled before they were
burned. The burning of a heretic was a great public
function which attracted crowds of spectators. In
order to make the pageant more ghastly, grotesque
dolls and corpses which had been dug up out of their
graves were carried in the procession and made to
dance round the flames.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">118</span></p>

<p>In Spain the Inquisition directed its attention
chiefly to Jews and Moors. But it became established
in other parts of Europe, notably in the Netherlands
and in Italy. Torquemada was Grand Inquisitor for
eighteen years. During that time he had 10,220 people
burned alive and 97,000 condemned to public
penitence or perpetual imprisonment. The Inquisition
was far more active and severe in Spain than in
Italy, where it dealt chiefly with Protestants. But a
resident at Rome in 1568, which is just about the time
we are dealing with, wrote: “Some are daily burned,
hanged, or beheaded; the prisons and places of confinement
are filled, and they are obliged to build new
ones.” The independence, the secrecy, and the far-extended
power of the Inquisition made it formidable
and terrifying while it lasted. The hideous cruelty
and savage barbarity of its methods render the story
of the Inquisition one of the blackest pages of the
history of the world.</p>

<p>From such a body as this there was very little
chance that a man with Bruno’s views would receive
justice or mercy.</p>

<p>Venice was at this time an independent republic,
and was a city of refuge for many who were expelled
from other parts of Italy. Rome was jealous of the
independent attitude of Venice, and the Pope demanded
that all spiritual offenders should be delivered
up to him. The Venetian authorities protested in
this case, but were obliged to yield. A lawyer who<span class="pagenum">119</span>
was consulted during the dispute, while acknowledging
that Bruno’s errors in heresy were very grave,
declared that he possessed “a most excellent rare
mind, with exquisite learning and wisdom.”</p>

<p>On his arrival in Rome he was at once cast into
a dungeon, as the Pope hoped to break his spirit by
prolonged imprisonment. For six whole years (1593
to 1599) nothing was heard of him. What his sufferings
were in the dark dungeons of the Inquisition
no one can tell. Whatever methods may have been
used to overcome his obstinate determination, they
were unsuccessful. For when at last he was visited
in 1599 he said that “he ought not to recant and he
would not recant; that he had nothing to recant, nor
any reason to recant, nor knew he what he should recant.”
Had he not written, too: “There are men in
whom the working of the will of God is so powerful
that neither threats nor contumely can cause them
to waver. He who fears the body has never felt himself
to be one with God. He alone is truly wise and
virtuous who fears no pain, and he is happy who
regards things with the eye of reason.”</p>

<p>At last sentence of death was passed on him. “Perhaps
you pronounce your sentence with greater fear
than that with which I receive it,” was his only reply
to his inhuman judges. From the presence of the
great assemblage of cardinals and theologians who
sat in judgment over him, the man whom suffering
could not move and for whom the condemnation of<span class="pagenum">120</span>
such a tribunal was no degradation was led from
the judgment hall and handed over to the governor
of the city. A day or two more in a solitary cell and
the end came.</p>

<p>There was a multitude of pilgrims in Rome at the
time. Some fifty cardinals were assembled to celebrate
the jubilee of the Pope. The Church was mustered
in all its glory. The last agony of the philosopher
no doubt served to enhance these triumphant
celebrations, although the burning of a heretic was
such a common occurrence that it probably caused
very little stir. The concluding scene has already
been described.</p>

<p>Nearly three hundred years later, in 1889, a statue
of Giordano Bruno, a picture of which is reproduced
here, was erected on the very spot in the Campo dei
Fiori at Rome where he was burned. The world is
learning slowly to respect liberty of conscience, to
admire sincerity, to detest intolerance, and to stamp
out the spirit of persecution. We are beginning to
understand that a really religious nature may exist
apart from any profession of faith in any particular
set of doctrines. And no sensible man now would
condemn as wicked and irreligious a courageous
thinker who fought throughout his career for freedom
and independence of thought, and refused to alter
his convictions to please others or even to save his
own life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> we read history, what a lot we have to learn
about wars! Invasions and conquests and sieges and
battles seem to cover more pages than anything else.
I think there is hardly a country in Europe that England
has not fought against at one time or another,
and not only in Europe, but in Asia, Africa, and
America. And although nations are supposed to be
getting more civilized, it does not seem to make any
difference—they go on fighting one another just the
same. If we took the wars from the Roman invasion
of Britain down to 1914, it would be a very long
list. We might be able to give the dates and name
the chief battles, but I doubt if we could always say
what was the cause of the war. The causes of war
are generally most difficult to discover, and historians
become rather confused and obscure when they deal
with that part of the subject. The truth is that causes<span class="pagenum">122</span>
are very difficult to disentangle. Generally there is
an occasion as well as a cause. The cause is the general
state of feeling that exists between two countries,
which again has to be traced back to a number of
different incidents and accidents: the occasion may
be some quite trifling event, which is just enough to
set the fire blazing. Without the occasion the state
of feeling might in time improve, and the same trifling
event, or a more serious event which concerned two
countries who were on friendly terms, might never
lead to war at all.</p>

<p>In the more barbarous ages men fought one another
because one race hated another race, or wanted to
capture its goods and its property. Men walked about
ready and eager to fight, and no one wanted to stop
them. We pretend we are much more civilized now,
and that we do not have these feelings, and yet without
these excuses we have constant wars. It does not
say much for what we are pleased to call our civilization.
Because, after all, killing a large number of
people, devastating countries, and destroying homes is
not an occupation that any one approves.</p>

<p>Then a period came when kings and great conquerors
wanted to win power and renown by leading
their armies out to battle and subduing their
neighbors. The motive was very much the same as
that of the barbarous man, but it was less natural
and spontaneous, because the people themselves were
less inclined to fight. They were, however, prepared
<span class="pagenum">123</span>and drilled, and taught that their country’s greatness
depended on its power of conquest and the size of its
territory.</p>

<img src="images/i_fp122.jpg" width="500" height="742" alt="HUGO GROTIUS." /></a>
<div class="caption">HUGO GROTIUS.</div>
</div>

<p>Then, too, a large number of wars were religious
wars. Men feel very deeply about their own religion,
and in the Middle Ages they were always ready to
fight others who did not share their particular belief.
The Crusades were by way of being religious
wars, but they were more an opportunity for great
fighters to go out and distinguish themselves on the
battlefield. Civilized people do not fight about religion
now, but there is no subject that makes them
quarrel and dispute more violently.</p>

<p>When kings were no longer able to drive their people
to fight just to satisfy their personal ambition,
and when people became more tolerant about religious
differences, other causes for wars arose. Governments
became ambitious and wanted their countries to expand
and acquire great colonial possessions, and acute
rivalry grew up between nations. This was encouraged
by the richer classes, who could profit by extended
trade, and as the means of communication and
of conveyance suddenly became much easier because
of steamships, trains, and telegraphy, the desire as
well as the possibility of building great Empires was
very much increased. The governing classes and those
who were rich and idle were not very much concerned
about the pressing need for social reform which the
vast mass of the people were longing for. They were<span class="pagenum">124</span>
interested in wars, and they could easily make them
popular by means of the newspapers which they had
at their command. Meanwhile, the people became
gradually more peace-loving. But this made no difference,
because they had no say in controlling the
relations of their country with other nations; they
were very easily misled because of their ignorance of
foreign policy and foreign countries, and they could
always be roused to fight by being told that their country
was in danger.</p>

<p>A disbelief in force was, however, slowly growing
up, and people were no longer impressed by the glory
of war. In their relations with one another individual
men left off fighting, because they found that quarrels
were better settled by reason, and they knew that the
man who happened to be the strongest physically or
the most skillful with arms was not necessarily in the
right, though he might kill or maim his opponent.</p>

<p>But while many nations within their own borders
were able to establish peaceful relations between their
citizens by means of law and order, the relationship
between the nations themselves could not be regulated
in the same way. In their infancy the nations
recognized no law, no regulations for warfare, and no
binding sense of obligation. There was no supreme
authority who could insist on obedience, and the only
way of settling differences was to fight it out. Agreements
between one ruler and another were of little
value; terrible barbarities and wholesale massacre<span class="pagenum">125</span>
were resorted to without protest; no sort of code of
honor or humanity was recognized, and justification
for hideous cruelty was often found by the Church in
the pages of the Bible.</p>

<p>At a period when Europe was one broad battlefield,
when wars were raging between races, between nations,
and between religious sects, and hatred, misery,
cruelty, and torture were filling the world with horror,
and in a country that was suffering more than any
other from these fearful evils, was born a man who,
in spite of the darkness around him and in spite of
the overwhelming forces which seemed to be subduing
mankind, set to work to save civilization from ruin
and to establish law and reason in the relations of
nations. This man was Huig de Groot, known afterwards
to the world as Hugo Grotius, who was born at
Delft, in Holland, on Easter Day of 1583. He will
be recognized for all time as the founder of international
law, and as the first man who awakened the
conscience of governments to a higher moral sense,
to more humanitarian feelings, and to the recognition
of the fact that there was such a thing as international
duty. “I saw,” he said, “in the whole Christian world
a license of fighting at which even barbarous nations
might blush. Wars were begun on trifling pretexts
or none at all, and carried on without any reverence
of law, Divine or human. A declaration of war
seemed to let loose every crime.”</p>

<p>The foundation of his idea was that the Law of<span class="pagenum">126</span>
Nations, that is to say, the agreements made between
governments, should be brought into harmony with
the principles of natural morality and the commands
of justice written, as he said, by God on the hearts
and minds of men. This he called the Law of Nature,
which man could discover by right reason. He
wanted, in fact, the same ideas of right and wrong
which people were taught to adopt in their dealings
with one another to be applied to the dealings of one
nation with another. Instead of saying that justice,
honor, generosity, and friendship meant one thing
between man and man and quite another thing between
nation and nation, he tried to combine the
two and bring the lower one up to the level of the
higher. Out of this union between the two sorts of
law he hoped to create an international law which
would put an end to the unreasonable, uncivilized,
and perpetually dangerous relationship which existed
between nations.</p>

<p>The great book he wrote was called “De Jure Belli
ac Pacis” (Concerning the Law of War and Peace).
He collected together in it quotations from a number
of great men, and elaborated his argument with wonderful
clearness and great learning. He condemned
the atrocities of warfare, and more especially he
pointed to a way in which war might be avoided. He
examined various methods by which international
questions might be settled without war, and proposed
the idea of conferences and international arbitration.<span class="pagenum">127</span>
In fact, it may be said that the seed of arbitration
was first sown when Grotius wrote the words: “But
specially are Christian kings and States bound to try
this way of avoiding war.” The book, indeed, in the
hands of those who followed him, became a mighty
weapon against the follies of rulers and the cruelties
of war. It could not have been written by a mere
scholar; it was not just a collection of quotations and
clever theories; it was the work of a man whose nobility
of heart and mind and whose earnestness and unselfishness
made his voice echo through the nations
and through the ages.</p>

<p>But you, who have known a war compared to which
the wars of the past seem as little battles, may well
ask whether the ideas of Grotius have really spread
and become of any permanent good. Well, I will try
to answer that question. The tremendous scale of the
great European war of the twentieth century is not
a measure of the wicked disposition of the nations
concerned, but is due more especially to the easy
methods of transport and communication, to the rapid
manner in which munitions can be manufactured, and
to the diabolical nature of modern inventions and engines
of destruction. That war could not be prevented
is not due to the frantic desire of the peoples to fight,
but to the policy of governments and ministers, to the
faulty methods of intercourse between nations, which
is called diplomacy, and to the inability of the people
to control their governments. So far from this catas<span class="pagenum">128</span>trophe
showing nations are more evilly disposed towards
one another than formerly, it is undoubtedly
true that mutual knowledge was beginning to produce
a new sympathy and understanding, and though it
has been checked, that movement will revive and
continue, perhaps with greater vigor.</p>

<p>Although there may be much to alter and much
to mend in ways that Grotius never dreamed of, the
prospect of the cessation of war is decidedly nearer,
in spite of this great failure. Such a prospect may
still be very remote—we cannot say—but it is as inevitable
as the rising of the sun, and we can either
help or hinder its coming. Therefore, in considering
the fact that the mind of man has been slowly preparing
for the abolition of the rule of force and the
establishment of the reign of reason, and that moral
law has been slowly but surely gaining ground over
belief in violence, we should ever turn with gratitude
to the man who took the first and most difficult step,
and who had sufficient foresight and courage, when
things seemed most hopeless, to look into the future.</p>

<p>The publication of such a book naturally caused a
great stir. It came out in 1625, and was immediately
placed by the Pope upon the Index—that is, the list
of books which Catholics were forbidden to read. It
was not a popular book in the sense that it could be
read by every one. The appeal was to thinking men.
Its influence therefore was very gradual. But slowly
the ideas set forth by Grotius found their way into<span class="pagenum">129</span>
laws and into treaties, and eminent lawyers in European
universities took the great work as a starting-point
of the further development of principles of international
law. There are two interesting instances
of how the influence of the book was immediately felt.
Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, who was the greatest
general of the time, made a careful study of “De
Jure Belli ac Pacis”: he kept it by his bedside, and
it was found in his tent after his death on the field
of Lützen. Gustavus constantly stood for mercy, and
began on a large scale the better conduct of modern
war. He made speeches to his soldiers dissuading
them from cruelty or rebuking them for it.</p>

<p>The other instance was in the case of the capture
of La Rochelle by Cardinal Richelieu, who governed
France in the name of Louis XIII. La Rochelle was
the stronghold of French Protestantism. All Europe
expected that the inhabitants would be massacred,
in accordance with the spirit of cruel intolerance
which was usual at that time, and which would certainly
be expected from the merciless Cardinal. But
to the amazement of the world there were no massacre,
no destruction, and no plunder, and the Huguenots
were treated with mercy and even respect. At
a later period, indeed, Cardinal Richelieu freed the
writings of Grotius from the French censorship, and
declared him one of the three great scholars of his
time.</p>

<p>The Treaty of Westphalia, which closed the Thirty<span class="pagenum">130</span>
Years War in 1648, may be added as another instance
of how Grotius had brought in a new epoch
in international affairs, for it contained principles
which he had been the first to bring into the thought
of the world. Nevertheless, the immediate influence
of Grotius’ book was not so great as the lasting service
he rendered in laying the foundation of a new science
of International Law, on which succeeding generations
slowly built up and strengthened the sense of morality
between nations. There is still very much to be
added; and new problems and new conditions require
new plans and new designs. But the foundation was
well laid and can never be shifted.</p>

<p>The book was criticized by some who declared that
it was just a shapeless collection of quotations, and
that the argument was lost under the mass of extracts
from other authorities. It is true that its arrangement
and style were rather heavy and clumsy, and
there is much in the book that may appear to us,
three hundred years afterwards, as rather crude, but
attack has come for the most part from those who
are quite unable to understand the high ideal toward
which Grotius was reaching out. A prominent English
international jurist, Sir James Mackintosh, has
declared that this great work “is perhaps the most
complete that the world has yet owed, at so early a
stage in the progress of any science, to the genius and
learning of one man.”</p>

<p>Now, I must give you some account of the life of<span class="pagenum">131</span>
the writer of this famous book. As you may imagine,
a man of such decided character, who had the courage
to express new and original views, was not allowed
to live in peace and quiet.</p>

<p>His father, John de Groot, was four times burgomaster
of Delft and one of the curators of the University
of Leyden. He was a great scholar, and acted
as tutor to his son Hugo. At a very early age the
boy showed the most extraordinary powers. At ten,
his Latin verses were praised by learned men; at
eleven, poets declared that he would be a second
Erasmus; at twelve, he was admitted to the University
of Leyden. He was, in fact, very precocious. It
very often happens with precocious children that they
are made to show off, and are so spoilt by their parents
that they become conceited, and when they grow
up they disappoint the expectations formed about
them when they were young. But his parents were
sensible, and he himself was naturally humble and
modest, and so he continued his studies and enriched
his mind without any harm being done to his character.
He produced immense learned books on many
different subjects, and at the age of fifteen held public
disputes in mathematics, philosophy, and law.</p>

<p>In 1598 he was appointed to accompany a special
Embassy which was being sent by the Netherlands
to the King of France, Henry IV. His reputation
had gone before him. The men of the day crowded
to see him, and the King received him and with his<span class="pagenum">132</span>
own hand hung his portrait round the youth’s neck.
So much flattery might easily have turned his head,
but he already showed a calm judgment and the wisdom
of a man of long experience. He did not loiter
in this pleasant atmosphere, but returned to his work
in Holland. But there was another danger before
him. He might have buried himself in his studies,
and, like other learned men of his time, and, indeed,
of all times, accumulated a lot of useless knowledge.
So many great scholars have become experts in some
particular subject, and have shut themselves off from
contact with their fellow-men. Their mind becomes
their idol, and they fail to see that mere brain-power
is of little service if it is not used for some great
purpose, and if it is not inspired by moral and humane
sentiments. Grotius avoided this course; he was anxious
for active life, and wanted to join in and help
his country and humanity in some practical way. He
had avoided becoming a prig, a prodigy, or a bookworm,
and when he took up the career of a lawyer
he also avoided using his rapid promotion for the
purpose of money-making and personal success. His
extraordinary talents were like the spreading sails of
a ship. They might have capsized him if he had not
had plenty of ballast.</p>

<p>How little he thought of fame and applause, and
how he worked for true knowledge and in order to
prepare himself for the future, is shown by the dis<span class="pagenum">133</span>covery
at The Hague, two hundred years later, of
a manuscript of a big book written by him when he
was twenty-two, but never published. One of the
chapters of this book he issued as a treatise under
the title of “Mare Liberum.” It was an argument
against the claim made by some nations, specially
Portugal at this time, that the seas could be owned
by a nation, and that no other nation could fish in
them or navigate them without her permission. Grotius
maintained the freedom of the seas was necessary
to enable nations to communicate with one another,
and it could not be taken away by any power whatever.
James I very much disapproved of this book,
as he thought it interfered with the rights of Great
Britain. He ordered his Ambassador in Holland to
take measures against the author. But as nothing
could be done, the King instructed the great English
lawyer, John Selden, to write a reply, which he did
in a learned book called “Mare Clausum.” But Grotius
really had the best of the argument, and his
view was eventually adopted.</p>

<p>Grotius, who had now gained an international reputation,
was given various high appointments, such as
Public Historiographer, Attorney-General for the
province of Holland, and councilor of Rotterdam. He
went to England and was received by the King with
the greatest cordiality, in spite of the recent dispute.
He made many friends in England, notably with the<span class="pagenum">134</span>
celebrated scholar, Isaac Casaubon, who expressed the
highest opinion of the great Dutchman in a letter
written in April, 1613. He says:</p>



<p class="small">I cannot say how happy I esteem myself in having seen
so much of one so truly great as Grotius. A wonderful
man! This I knew him to be before I had seen him; but
the rare excellence of that divine genius no one can sufficiently
feel who does not see his face and hear him speak.
Probity is stamped on his features; his conversation savors
of true piety and profound learning. It is not only
upon me that he has made this impression; all the pious
and learned to whom he has been introduced here have
felt the same towards him; the King especially so.</p>

<p>Grotius returned to his country, where serious
trouble awaited him. The cause of it all was, to
begin with, a religious squabble between two sects,
the one followers of Arminius, who believed in free-will,
the other followers of Gomarus, who believed in
predestination. This senseless dispute on a question
which can never be settled—that is to say, whether
man is free to shape his own destiny or whether his
acts are all fated beforehand by God—was only an
excuse for a quarrel between the more bigoted and
intolerant religious sects who sided with Gomarus and
the freer and more broadminded who followed Arminius.
The whole country was convulsed by the controversy.
The Arminians drew up a Remonstrance,
which was answered by a Counter Remonstrance, and
the Parliament issued an Edict of Pacification, urg<span class="pagenum">135</span>ing
tolerance and forbearance, which was largely due
to the influence of Grotius.</p>

<p>Advantage was taken of this disturbance by Prince
Maurice of Orange, the second son of William the
Silent. He was an accomplished soldier, but a weak
and untrustworthy statesman, and thought it a good
opportunity to assert himself and satisfy his personal
ambition to become a monarch. He undertook what
he was pleased to call a pacific campaign, and seeing
that the Gomarists were more popular than their opponents,
many of whom favored a republic rather than
a monarchy, he practically took their side.</p>

<p>Olden Barneveld, the Grand Pensionary, who now
led the opposition to the Prince, is one of the notable
figures in the history of the Netherlands. He was
an old and experienced minister, a true patriot, a
humane and broadminded man, who had rendered
the most distinguished service to his country. The
Gomarists sided with the Prince, the Arminians with
the Grand Pensionary. Grotius unhesitatingly followed
Olden Barneveld, and struggled with all his
great powers for peace and toleration. He had conferences
with Prince Maurice, headed a deputation,
made eloquent appeals, but all in vain. The Prince
continued his campaign, the civic guards were disarmed
and disbanded wherever they resisted him.
Barneveld and Grotius, and also Hoogerbertz of Leyden,
who had joined them, were arrested and taken
to the castle at The Hague. Barneveld, now an old<span class="pagenum">136</span>
man of over seventy, was subjected to twenty-three
examinations, during which he was neither allowed
to take down questions in writing, to make memoranda
of his answers, nor to refer to notes. In spite
of his reputation, his services, and his advanced age,
he was condemned to death and executed. From the
scaffold he cried to the spectators: “My friends, believe
not that I am a traitor. I have lived a good
patriot, and such I die.” Grotius was condemned
to imprisonment for life and his property was confiscated.
Their followers were seized, imprisoned, or
banished to neighboring countries, just as the Puritans
were driven from England and the Huguenots
from France.</p>

<p>It was in June, 1619, that Grotius was shut up in
the fortress of Louvenstein; he was only thirty-six,
and he had no prospect now before him but that of
lifelong captivity. Eleven years before he had married
Marie Reigersberg, a lady of great intelligence
and high character. She now stepped in, showed wonderful
ingenuity, and played a very courageous part
in her husband’s fortunes.</p>

<p>Pressure had been brought to bear on her after the
execution of Barneveld. The scaffold on which he
had been executed was left standing for fifteen days,
so as to frighten the other prisoners. Grotius’ wife
was specially urged to get an acknowledgment of guilt
from her husband and solicit a pardon for him, and
promises were held out to her of a favorable hearing<span class="pagenum">137</span>
on the part of the Prince of Orange. But she stoutly
refused to cast this dishonor on her husband, and with
fierce resolution declared: “I will not do it—if he
has deserved it, let them strike off his head.”</p>

<p>In the prison of Louvenstein Grotius found consolation
in his studies. He never yielded to despair,
but occupied his whole time reading, composing, and
translating. His devoted wife, after several petitions,
at last received permission to share his captivity, on
the condition that if she came out she would not be
allowed to return. She made friends with the jailer’s
wife and others who might be of use, and after nearly
two years she thought out a method of escape. The
prisoner was allowed books. These were sent in a
large chest, and those he had done with were sent
back, together with his washing, to Gorcum. After
a time Marie Grotius noticed that the warders let the
chest pass without opening it. One day she persuaded
her husband, after much entreaty, to get into the
chest, in which she had had some holes bored. She
locked it up and asked the soldiers to come in and
carry it out as usual. It was a great risk, for she
must have known that, had her plot been discovered,
she and her husband would suffer heavy penalties.
She must have exercised great self-control to prevent
herself showing any sign of agitation or excitement.
The soldiers complained that the chest was unusually
heavy. “There must be an Arminian in it,” said one
of them jestingly. Madame Grotius replied calmly,<span class="pagenum">138</span>
“There are indeed Arminian books in it.” There was
a river to be crossed, and the chest was put in a boat.
The soldiers declared it ought to be opened, but a
maid and a valet who were in the plot managed to
prevent this. The precious load was to be taken to
the house of one of Grotius’ friends in Gorcum. But
if it was to be heaved about like ordinary luggage,
what would happen to the unfortunate captive inside,
who was terribly cramped as it was? The maid had
great presence of mind, and told the people on the
shore that the chest was full of glass, and must be
moved with particular care. So they got a horse-chair
and shifted it very carefully to the appointed
place. Grotius’ friend received the chest, and after
he had sent all his servants out on various errands,
opened it and greeted the escaped prisoner with open
arms.</p>

<p>Grotius declared he was none the worse for the
adventure, although he had naturally felt anxious
lest he might be discovered. There was no time to
be lost; he disguised himself as a mason, carrying a
rule, hod, and trowel, and went out of the back door,
accompanied by the maid, who did not leave him until
he had reached safety. Then she returned to his wife
and told her how successfully the plot had worked.
Marie Grotius immediately informed the governor of
the prison that her husband had escaped. She was
placed in close confinement, but after a few days,
by order of the States General, she was released and<span class="pagenum">139</span>
joined her husband, who had gone to Paris after spending
a day or two at Antwerp.</p>

<p>On arriving in France, Louis XIII gave Grotius
a cordial welcome, and a high pension was conferred
on him. French pensions were easily granted, all the
more so as they were rarely paid. It was in France,
at the château of Balagni, which had been lent to
him, that Grotius gave final shape to the great work
of his life, the book on war and peace which I have
already mentioned. A man treated as he had been
might have been tempted to indulge in an attack on
the authorities; he might have occupied his time satirizing
his enemies and scoffing at the many signs of
human folly he saw around him. But he did nothing
of the sort. After writing an apology defending himself
against the charges brought against him, he
worked day and night to reconstruct, reform, and improve
the foundations of human society. The book
brought him in no profit whatever in the way of money,
but it brought him reputation so widely spread and of
such a lasting nature as no other legal work has ever
enjoyed. He did not contemplate immediate success,
but even so, he said, “ought we not to sow the seed
which may be useful for posterity.”</p>

<p>But Grotius and his wife were very badly off, as
the pension was paid irregularly. Cardinal Richelieu
wanted to make use of his talents, but the terms he
demanded, which would have deprived Grotius from
having any freedom, prevented any such arrangement<span class="pagenum">140</span>
being possible. Accordingly, the Cardinal made
things uncomfortable for him, and Grotius decided
once more to attempt to live in his native land. But
his reception in Holland was anything but cordial.
His enemies were active, and the States General offered
a high reward to any one who would deliver
him up to them. So again he became an exile, and
took refuge this time in Hamburg. He hoped his countrymen
might return to reason, and so refused flattering
offers made to him by the King of Denmark, by
Spain, and even by Wallenstein, who was practically
dictator of Germany.</p>

<p>At last he gave up all hope and entered the service
of Sweden as Ambassador in Paris. Gustavus
Adolphus of Sweden had died, and his only child
Christina became Queen. During her childhood the
Chancellor Oxenstiern acted as Regent. Grotius received
his appointment from him in 1635. His mission
was important and somewhat delicate. He had
to keep up an active alliance between France and
Sweden. Cardinal Richelieu was not easy to deal
with, but the Ambassador showed his usual qualities
of moderation and firmness, and succeeded towards
the close of his embassy in renewing the treaty between
Sweden and France on terms which were considered
to do great honor to his diplomatic talents.
He was troubled a good deal by the etiquette and
ceremonial of diplomacy, and became involved in foolish
disputes about rank and ceremonial questions,<span class="pagenum">141</span>
to which diplomatists have always attributed an exaggerated
amount of importance. We can imagine
that Grotius, with his clear mind and disregard of
trivialities, may have offended his colleagues. It must
have irritated them to associate with a man who, instead
of chattering nonsense while waiting in the ante-rooms
at court, would sit apart studying his Greek
Testament.</p>

<p>He remained in the Swedish service for about ten
years, but the life became irksome to him; the Swedish
Government were inclined to think that a man
who devoted so much of his time to writing could not
give sufficient attention to diplomatic work, and at
last Grotius applied for his recall. This was granted
by Queen Christina, who had a very high opinion of
the Ambassador, and received him in Stockholm on
his return with every mark of favor. On quitting
France, he passed on his way to Sweden through
Amsterdam and Rotterdam, where he was more kindly
received. The Queen of Sweden did her best to persuade
Grotius to remain in her service as a Councilor
of State, but he was bent on returning to Holland.
Accordingly, on August 12, 1645, having received presents
of money and plate from the Queen, he embarked
for Lübeck. A violent storm drove the vessel on to
the Pomeranian coast. Grotius, after a journey in
an open wagon through wind and rain, arrived very
ill at Rostock. Here he died in the presence of a
Lutheran pastor, John Quistorp, who has left an ac<span class="pagenum">142</span>count
of his last moments. Quistorp, at his bedside,
read him the parable of the Pharisee and the Publican,
ending with the words, “God be merciful to me,
a sinner,” and the dying scholar and statesman answered,
“I am that Publican.” After repeating a
prayer with the pastor, Grotius sank exhausted and
breathed his last. He was buried first of all at Rostock,
but as his wish was to rest in his native soil, his
body was taken after a time to the Netherlands. It
is difficult to believe, were it not historically true,
that as the coffin was borne through the city of Rotterdam
stones were thrown at it by the bigoted mob.
It was laid finally in a crypt beneath the great church
of Delft, his birthplace. The remains of two great
champions of liberty and justice lie beneath the same
roof, for close by the grave of Grotius is the sculptured
tomb of William the Silent. His wife died
shortly afterwards at The Hague. She had stood by
him in the hour of need, encouraged him, consoled
him, and helped him, and the story of his life will
never be read without praise being given to the noble
part she played in it.</p>

<p>I have said very little about the writings of Grotius,
because it is impossible to describe fully all the
learned books he brought out. Just as in the field of
politics he worked for pacification, so in the world
of religion he endeavored to the utmost of his ability
to produce universal peace. He tried to find a simple
statement of belief to which all contending parties<span class="pagenum">143</span>
would agree, and published a book called “The Road
to Religious Peace.” “Perhaps,” he said, “by writing
to reconcile such as entertain very opposite sentiments,
I shall offend both parties: but if that should
so happen I shall comfort myself with the example
of him who said, ‘If I please men I am not the servant
of Christ.’” He did offend both parties. No mere
form of words can reconcile deep-seated differences
in religious sentiment. Others before Grotius, and
many too since, have made the same attempt to bring
the different sections of religious thought together,
but none have succeeded. The only advance that has
been made has been an increase in the spirit of tolerance,
which tends to prevent any outrageous persecution
of one sect by another.</p>

<p>It seems curious that Christians, who people the
nations which are by way of being the most civilized,
should be more torn with religious discord, and
should be more responsible for the world’s wars, than
the peoples of other religions who inhabit the globe.
They pretend to be followers of the Prince of Peace
and to believe in the brotherhood of mankind, while
the Church of Christ has become split into an ever-increasing
number of warring sects, and the jealousy
and enmity of nations are allowed to break into ever
more ferocious armed conflict and mutual massacre.</p>

<p>The hope of improvement in these fundamental human
relationships, national and religious, depends to
a large extent on the number of men who are wise<span class="pagenum">144</span>
or farsighted enough to turn the mind of man away
from the differences that lead to division and to
strengthen the forces that lead to unity—in fact, to
substitute harmony for discord. But the work will
always progress slowly, because there are still so many
natures which prefer fighting just from the love of
quarreling, and they turn their anger against a conciliator
even more violently than against those with
whom they bitterly disagree.</p>

<p>Grotius himself saw no apparent result of his great
work, and time alone has proved in his case that the
originator of great ideals and the worker for truth
leaves to the world a gift for which countless generations
that succeed him are grateful, though he may
only receive scoffs and rebuke from men of his own
time.</p>

<p>Unlike Giordano Bruno and Voltaire, he did not
turn his talents into weapons of attack and destruction.
He respected other people’s opinions, and was
able to judge with impartiality his worst enemies.
This is an extremely rare quality in one who is engaged
in controversy. For instance, in his history of
the Netherlands, he commented without a trace of
ill-will on the policy and even praised the services
as commander and patriot of Maurice of Orange—the
man who had unjustly deprived him of his home,
his property, and his freedom. No personal petty
spite could disturb his judgment. With deep penetration
he recognized that the spirit of the age was<span class="pagenum">145</span>
clouded by want of reason, and nations and individuals
were forced unnecessarily into strife from
want of proper guidance. His high-minded character,
his well-balanced judgment, and his disinterested motive
gave Grotius a reserve of strength and a noble
resolution which few have possessed in the same degree
or used with equal effect.</p>

VOLTAIRE<br /><br />

1694–1778</h2>

<p class="center"><small>

</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> the twelve men written of in this book, with
the exception of Tolstoy, who died recently, Voltaire
will probably be the best known by name. He is
rather different from most of the others, because he
preferred to try and reach men’s minds by argument
rather than their hearts by religious appeal. He was
a great disturber of smug, self-satisfied opinion; he
knew how utterly fatal were laziness of mind and
stagnation of ideas. He wanted to disturb, to annoy,
to provoke, and, more even than any of the others,
he succeeded in his object.</p>

<p>In his long life he wrote an astonishing number of
letters, poems, plays, and pamphlets, and he wrote
very beautifully. But his fame does not rest on his
literary genius. Had his works all been romances
and plays, and were he to be judged on his merits as
a writer, genius though he was, there are many greater
geniuses than he. It was his striking personality,<span class="pagenum">148</span>
his startling opinions, and his daring and original
arguments which gained for him his reputation and
his extraordinary influence. In fact, the middle of
the eighteenth century in France is known as “the
age of Voltaire.” Of course, he made many bitter
enemies, and to this day his opinions are warmly disputed.
His method was often unnecessarily provocative.
He was stingingly satirical; he scoffed, he jeered,
he ridiculed his opponents, and by the brilliant thrusts
of his pointed wit cut them to the quick. On the
whole, his object was more to destroy than to construct,
and he left no new scheme or systems of belief,
of thought or policy for others to follow when his
personal influence had passed away. Although there
is a good deal that is far from admirable in his career,
the force of his personality was so great that he could
not be ignored, and all he wrote and all he said was
eagerly read and listened to by every one. He loathed
shams and superstitions, and he fought most vehemently
in his later life against injustice and oppression.
In fact, he was a strange mixture. One can
hardly believe that the sly, fawning courtier can be
the same man as the bold and courageous champion
of liberty and justice, or that the mischievous joker
and the great dramatist are one and the same person.
In his long life he went through different phases,
but taking him as a whole, he stands out as the principal
figure of the eighteenth century in Europe.</p>

<div class="caption">VOLTAIRE</div>
</div>

<p>Voltaire’s real name was François Marie Arouet.
<span class="pagenum">149</span>He was the youngest of the five children of a well-to-do
solicitor, and was born in Paris on November
21, 1694. He had to be hurriedly baptized, as no one
expected that the puny little infant would live. His
first teacher was his godfather, a rather disreputable
priest, called Châteauneuf, and he was taught at an
early age that religion, as it existed in France at
that time, was mere superstition and pretense. His
mother died when he was seven, and at the age of
ten he was sent off to a large Jesuit college, where,
as he afterwards tells us, he learned “Latin and nonsense.”
His quick wits, however, made him absorb
an immense quantity of information; and instead of
playing with the other boys, he would walk and talk
with the masters. One of them said at the time,
“That boy wants to weigh the great questions of
Europe in his little scales.” The verses he wrote
brought him into prominence, and his godfather introduced
him to Ninon de l’Enclos, a famous old lady
of nearly eighty, who was still the center of the most
brilliant society in Paris. When she died, a few
months later, she left him two thousand francs with
which to buy books.</p>

<p>Acting at school encouraged in him a love of drama,
and he soon began to try his hand at writing plays.
He was only twelve when he wrote a petition in verse
to the King, asking for a pension for an old soldier.
Louis XIV read it, and the old soldier got his pension.
His father wanted him to be a lawyer, and<span class="pagenum">150</span>
laughed at the idea of his becoming an author; but
although he was made to study law, the boy stood
up to the rough old man and refused to give in. He
soon got into a very gay but very frivolous society,
which he amused by his audacity and wit. Sometimes
he would return home very late from his orgies, and
father Arouet would lock him out so that he had to
walk the streets all night. In fact, the peppery old
father and the mad young scapegrace were perpetually
quarreling. The boy was irrepressible, and it was
useless his father trying to subject him to discipline.
He was given a post as attaché to the Ambassador to
the Netherlands, but this did not last. He occupied
himself in a purely frivolous way, had a love affair
with a young lady at The Hague, and was sent home
again. On his return he was invited to a castle at
Fontainebleau where there was a magnificent library.
Here this surprising young gentleman began working
very seriously at some of the greatest of the books
he produced in after-life.</p>

<p>In an age when any free expression of ideas was
liable to be severely punished it was fairly probable
that such a young man as this would get into trouble.
Curiously enough, young Arouet’s first experience of
prison came about in consequence of the publication
of a poem which he had not written. The poem was
a satire on the Regent Orleans who ruled over France
while Louis XV was still a child. Suspicion fell on
him, and he was locked up in the Bastille, the fortress<span class="pagenum">151</span>
into which many innocent men were cast and often
forgotten. He was not allowed pen and ink for some
time, but his active brain and wonderful memory
allowed him to conceive and invent many things which
he afterwards produced in writing. His imprisonment
lasted a year, and he came out with his name changed
to Voltaire, supposed to be an anagram on Arouet,
L. J. (le jeune).</p>

<p>His father was enraged at his imprisonment. “I
told you so! I knew his idleness would lead to disgrace,”
he said. But the boy did not feel at all disgraced.
When he came home he set to work, and
before the end of the year he brought out his first
play, <i>Œdipe</i>, which was the real beginning of his
brilliant career.</p>

<p>It was an immediate success, and attracted a great
deal of attention. Even the Regent and his family
came to one of the performances. In consequence of
this, Voltaire was asked to grand houses and was the
guest of great people, whom he amused and entertained
in his original way. He received a pension
from the Court, and when his father died more money
came to him. He invested his capital very judiciously,
and, unlike most geniuses, he thoroughly understood
his bank-book, so that he never fell into need or
poverty.</p>

<p>His next production was <i>The Henriade</i>, an epic
poem on Henry of Navarre. The chief event in it was
the massacre of St. Bartholomew, and this gave him<span class="pagenum">152</span>
an opportunity of expressing his hatred of fanaticism
and superstition. It was censored, but he managed
secretly to get two thousand copies into Paris, and the
very fact of its being forbidden fruit ensured its
success. As time went on, he came into close contact
with the Court, and was patronized by Marie Leczinska,
daughter of the ex-King of Poland, who was to
be married to Louis XV. She read his poems and
plays with pleasure and amusement, and for three
months he was the idol of the royal circle. Anxious,
however, as he had been to go to Court, he was more
than glad to get away.</p>

<p>Voltaire never enjoyed good health. Hardly a week
passed without his suffering, and when he became a
victim to smallpox his case was serious. In this connection
as much as in any other, Voltaire’s pluck and
indomitable will-power showed itself. He fought ill-health
all his life through, and triumphed. His great
secret was work. Others might make an excuse of
illness to take a holiday. That was not his way. He
dictated, he wrote, he read, to prevent physical weakness
getting the mastery over him. Another of his
finer characteristics was his undefeated persistence.
He never would give in. For instance, when a play
of his was a failure, he was disappointed, but took it
back and rewrote it. Even at the age of eighty-three
he did this with a play that did not please him. All
attempts to silence, suppress, insult, or ignore such a
man were bound to fail. There are two instances of<span class="pagenum">153</span>
his being twice badly insulted. A spy named Beauregard,
whom he offended, waylaid him in the street
and beat him. And again later, the Chevalier de
Rohan, an arrogant nobleman, fell out with him, and
had him thrashed by his servants. Voltaire took lessons
in fencing, and after three months challenged
Rohan, who accepted the challenge. But on the morning
appointed for the duel Voltaire was arrested, and
sent a second time to the Bastille. He was kept in
confinement for a fortnight, and then, at his own request,
packed off to England.</p>

<p>George II was King of England. He was no lover
of “boetry,” but Queen Caroline was, and was pleased
to welcome him. Voltaire’s chief friend in England
was Bolingbroke, and he soon became acquainted with
the leading people of the day. There were Swift and
Addison, whose writings he greatly admired; Pope,
Congreve, Gay, the Walpoles, and Sarah, Duchess of
Marlborough. Newton died during his visit; he attended
the funeral at Westminster Abbey, and was
much impressed by the tribute paid by the nation to
a man of science. He diligently mastered the English
language, and wrote not only letters but plays and
poems in it. He expresses in his writings the greatest
appreciation of British liberty, freedom of speech,
and absence of intolerance. The Quakers specially interested
him. He liked the simplicity of their religion,
and the absence of formulas, dogmas, creeds, and
ritual. He quotes one of them as saying in reply<span class="pagenum">154</span>
to his question, “You have no priests, then?” “No,
friend, and we get on very well without them.”</p>

<p>Moreover, as an inveterate hater of war, he revered
a sect so far removed from the brutality of military
government as to hold peace for a first principle of
the Christian faith. His affection for England and
the English spirit can be summed up in the words he
used with regard to Swift’s writings, “How I love
people who say what they think! We only half live
if we dare only half think.” Through him a more
intimate knowledge of England was spread, not only
in France but in other parts of the Continent.</p>

<p>In 1729, when he was thirty-five, he obtained a license
to return to France, which he had only been
able to visit secretly, now and then, during his stay
in England. He devoted the next four years to great
literary activity. Whatever he wrote always produced
a certain sensation, and often brought him into
trouble. Among the best of his productions were
<i>Zaïre</i>, the most successful of all his plays, and <i>The
Temple of Taste</i>, a brilliant burlesque, in which he
satirized the overrated celebrities of the day. Owing
to the death of one of his patrons with whom he had
been staying, he was obliged to go into uncomfortable
lodgings in a poor quarter of Paris. But whether he
was in a castle or a garret, his genius for hard work
never left him. The censor kept his eye on this man,
who seemed bent on startling and shocking the authorities,
so that Voltaire was often obliged to get his<span class="pagenum">155</span>
writings privately printed and secretly distributed,
and even on some occasions to deny the authorship
of the offending works. Things came to a head when
his <i>English Letters</i> appeared. They were by way of
being criticism and praise of England, but at the same
time they were a vehement attack on everything established
in Church and State in France. The printer
was thrown into the Bastille. The book was denounced
and publicly burnt by the hangman as “scandalous,
contrary to religion, to morals, and respect
for authority.” His lodgings were searched, but when
the officer came to arrest him the author was found
to have escaped.</p>

<p>France, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,
more than any other country at any other time, produced
a number of women who occupied a very leading
position, not only in the high society of Paris,
but in the intellectual and political life of the nation.
They collected in their houses all the eminent men
of letters and science and politics, who not only came
to meet one another, but were attracted by the charm,
the beauty, the wit, and the intelligence of their hostesses.
Attempts have been made at other times and
in other countries to imitate these French <i>salons</i>, but
without anything like the same success. The names
of some of these women have become historical—Madame
de Sévigné, Madame de Staël, Ninon de l’Enclos,
Madame du Châtelet, Madame du Deffand, Mademoiselle
de l’Espinasse—to mention only a few of<span class="pagenum">156</span>
them. Voltaire was a favorite with those of his time,
more especially with Madame du Châtelet, who went
so far as to place her castle at Cirey at his disposal.
She was a very clever woman, wrote books on philosophy,
and at the same time she was extremely frivolous—just
the sort of combination Voltaire loved. At
Cirey he interested himself in refurnishing the house
and in gardening. He set up a laboratory and experimented
in physics; he busied himself with iron-founding;
he studied astronomy and philosophy with
his hostess, made love to her, quarreled with her over
trifles, for she had a very hot temper; and all the
while kept on producing an almost incredible amount
of writings. Cirey became his home and headquarters
till Madame du Châtelet died in 1749. During this
period he came again into Court favor, wrote a play
which was performed before the King, and was made
Historiographer and Gentleman of the Chamber.</p>

<p>One of the most curious and interesting incidents
in Voltaire’s life was his friendship with Frederick
the Great of Prussia. After the exchange of many
enthusiastic and ridiculously complimentary letters,
they met first in 1740, and subsequently Voltaire went
over to Berlin on a diplomatic mission. But it was
not till 1751 that he went and stayed for any length
of time with his royal friend. Half the world watched
the meetings of the two most prominent men of the
day. They were very different, and this made their
intimacy all the more surprising. The very slender<span class="pagenum">157</span>
link that united them was little more than flattery.
The worst qualities of both soon came to the front, and
led finally to their separation. Frederick was an arrogant
disciplinarian, combining with his genius as
a soldier an artistic sense and some literary talent.
He welcomed Voltaire because he liked to gather
round him celebrated men of every description, and
he hoped to gain advantage from the advice and
amusement from the company of the greatest writer
and wit of his age. Voltaire, on his side, loved appreciation,
especially from great people. The pomp and
display of Courts attracted him; he was taken in by
the honors and praise that were lavishly showered
on him. He was content to correct Frederick’s writings,
and to be in close contact with the great man.
But, like a spoilt child, he became mischievous, and
the harmony between the two men, which was only on
the surface, became a hideous discord.</p>

<p>Voltaire was given apartments in the palace; he
was made a royal chamberlain, decorated with an
order, and granted a pension. Royal servants attended
on him; he supped with the King, and took
part in an endless round of feasts and entertainments.
But foolishly delighted as he was with all these honors,
he noticed that the King was apt to give a sly
scratch with one hand while patting and stroking with
the other. Voltaire used to refer to him by the nickname
“Luc,” after an ape which had a knack of biting.
“The supper parties are delicious,” he wrote;
<span class="pagenum">158</span>
“the King is the life of the company. I have operas
and comedies, reviews and concerts, my studies and
books: Berlin is fine, the princesses charming, the
maids of honor handsome, <span class="smcap">but</span> ... !”</p>

<p>The magnificence of his style of living gradually
began to fall off, and Frederick cut down his allowance
of sugar, coffee and chocolate, and the philosopher
stooped to pocketing candle-ends from the royal
apartments. Voltaire began quarreling with others at
the Court. Plots and intrigues, petty jealousies and
rivalries began to make his life intolerable. He was
mixed up in a discreditable affair connected with
money matters which came out in a sordid dispute between
him and a Jew named Hirsch. In fact, all the
glamour was fading; the glitter was proving to be very
far from gold. He never took the trouble to learn
German, as French was the language of the Court
and good German books were rare. Lessing, the
founder of modern German literature, was still quite
a young man. The two men met and made friends,
but the inevitable quarrel soon separated them.</p>

<p>At last Voltaire became bored to death with correcting
Frederick’s verses: “See,” he exclaimed when
a batch was sent to him, “what a quantity of dirty
linen the King has sent me to wash.” The remark
reached the royal ear, while on the other hand Voltaire
was told that Frederick when speaking of him
had said something about “sucking an orange and
throwing away the rind.” The finishing touch to the
<span class="pagenum">159</span>
growing estrangement was put by Voltaire’s wittiest
and most pitiless personal satire on Maupertuis, the
president of the Berlin Academy, a vain but worthy
individual. Frederick could not help laughing at it,
but he forbade its publication. Voltaire pretended to
agree, but in a few days the <i>Diatribe of Doctor Akakia</i>
appeared. It was received with great applause
and merriment, but Frederick was furious. He ordered
the pamphlet to be burned by the hangman and
insisted on an apology from Voltaire, who in his turn
sent back his order and chamberlain’s key. This was
the last straw, and Voltaire left Berlin. But he carried
off with him a volume of Frederick’s verses, probably
as a curiosity. He was arrested at Frankfurt
and treated with uncalled-for brutality by order of
the King.</p>

<p>The whole visit reflects no credit whatever on either
of the parties. Voltaire’s foolish vanity and hot temper
seem to have obscured an intellect shrewd enough
to have known that such a life as he lived in the Prussian
capital was empty, profitless, and utterly vain.
For Frederick there was more excuse, because monarchs
at all times have claimed service and homage
in return for a passing smile of friendship; Court attendance
they have considered a sufficiently rich reward
for any devotion; and thrones have ever been
surrounded by the refuse of orange-rinds out of which
the juice has been sucked.</p>

<p>Voltaire, now over sixty, entered upon the last<span class="pagenum">160</span>
phase of his life, which was the calmest and certainly
the noblest. After wandering from place to place, he
settled down at last in a house just outside Geneva,
which he called <i>Les Délices</i>. Here he entertained
many visitors and had a private theater in which his
own plays were performed, he himself always taking
a part and stage managing. He kept up a voluminous
correspondence and continued to exchange letters with
Frederick, quarreling as usual but finally making it
up. He wrote at this time one of his most famous
works, “Candide,” which was inspired by an earthquake
at Lisbon, and in it he ridiculed the idea that
everything was for the best in the best possible of all
worlds. The book was burned by order of the Council
of Geneva. But Voltaire was now accustomed to
his writings being treated in this way.</p>

<p>In appearance he must have been a very peculiar
figure. He was very thin, he had a long nose and
protruding chin, and his face always wore an amused
but rather mischievous smile. His sparkling eyes,
peering from under his heavy wig, showed he was very
much alive. His health always troubled him, and nobody
spoke about dying so much or thought so little
about death. From <i>Les Délices</i> he would drive into
Geneva in an extraordinary old-fashioned carriage
painted blue with gold stars and drawn by four horses.
On one occasion a crowd assembled to see him alight.
“What do you want to see, boobies?” he cried. “A<span class="pagenum">161</span>
skeleton? Well, here is one!” And he threw off his
cloak.</p>

<p>A few years later he bought another property near
by, called Ferney, and erected a château, where he
spent the remainder of his days. Here he developed
into a complete country gentleman, and came to be
known all over Europe as the Squire of Ferney. He
took great pride in all the details of the arrangements
in the house. He had a bath-room made, which
in those days was an almost unknown luxury, but he
was very particular in matters of cleanliness and was
very neat and tidy. His niece, Madame Denis, however,
who kept house for him, was slovenly and a
bad manager. She was an ugly and tiresome woman,
without humor or even common sense. She actually
wrote a comedy, which the players, out of respect for
Voltaire, declined to act. She was responsible for a
good deal of extravagance in the household, as well
as neglect in keeping the house clean. Her uncle,
who could not bear the sight of a cobweb, took advantage
of her absence in Paris at one time to have the
whole house cleaned from top to bottom. There were
a large number of servants, and two of them once
robbed their master. The police having got wind of
the matter, Voltaire sent a message to the culprits
to fly directly, or else he would not be able to save
them from hanging. He even sent them money for
the journey. So touched were they by his generosity<span class="pagenum">162</span>
that, having got away successfully, they settled down
to live honest lives. Gardens, park, farms, nurseries,
bees and silkworms, all received personal attention
from this wonderful little old philosopher. An immense
number of visitors, many of them celebrated
people, were entertained, and after theatricals, sometimes
as many as eighty people sat down to supper.
Indeed, he became a little weary of being what he
called “an hotel-keeper.” Some visitors stayed with
him for a considerable time, and the grand-niece of
the poet Corneille he adopted as a daughter.</p>

<p>Though now an old man, his life at Ferney, like his
life at Cirey, was one of ceaseless activity. Never
can any one have written so many letters. Seven
thousand have been printed, but there are many more:
and his correspondents ranged from kings and empresses
to the humblest and most undistinguished people.
With all his faults, and he had many, Voltaire
never fell a prey to two of the worst failings of which
a human being can be guilty—indifference and indolence.</p>

<p>Let us try and picture a day at Ferney. Voltaire
did not appear till eleven o’clock. He remained in his
room, where he had five desks all very carefully and
neatly arranged with the notes and papers for the
various works on which he was engaged. The rest
of the morning he spent in garden or farm superintending
and giving orders. He dined with the house-party,
eating very little himself, his only form of in<span class="pagenum">163</span>dulgence
being coffee. After some conversation with
his guests in the early afternoon, he retired to his
study and refused to be interrupted by anybody till
supper-time. Then he came out in very lively spirits,
led the conversation, provoked discussion, and amused
every one with his jokes and repartees. In the evening
there was probably a theatrical entertainment in
his little theater, or he would read out some of his
poems, or play chess, the only game he ever indulged
in. When he went to bed he started work afresh, and
as he slept very little, this would go on sometimes
far into the night, especially if he had a play on hand.
Madame Denis looked after the guests, some of whom,
to their great annoyance, saw very little of their host.</p>

<p>It was in the last twenty years of his life that Voltaire
played such a noble part in championing the
cause of men who were subjected to gross and cruel
persecution. The most famous case is that of Callas.
He was a Protestant shopkeeper in Toulouse, a kind
and benevolent old man. The monstrous accusation
brought against him was that of murdering his son,
who, as a matter of fact, committed suicide in a fit of
melancholy. The motive of the murder was supposed
to be that the son wanted to become a Roman Catholic,
and his father, rather than allow it, killed him.
Callas was tried and condemned without a shred of
evidence against him. He was tortured with hideous
cruelty, broken on the wheel, and finally strangled.
This was in 1762. Some of the family fled to Switzer<span class="pagenum">164</span>land,
and Voltaire heard of the case. He soon saw
that behind it lay the thing he hated most in the world,
namely, religious intolerance. He set to work with
an energy and perseverance which were quite extraordinary.
He left off his usual literary work; he examined
evidence, drew up reports, wrote statements
and narratives, collected a fund, composed pamphlets,
wrote to influential people, and devoted his whole
time and thoughts and much money to the cause he
had undertaken. He succeeded in getting a new trial,
and at last, three years after the savage sentence had
been passed on Callas, a unanimous verdict of complete
innocence was recorded by a council of forty
judges. The whole of Europe had heard of the case,
because it was Voltaire who had taken up the cause
of the poor and honest man who had been the victim
of a vile plot. Nothing in his life gave him more satisfaction
than his success in this affair. Thirteen
years later an old woman in Paris, in reply to some
one who asked who the little old man was whom
crowds surrounded, said, “It is the saviour of Callas.”
No honor that ever came to Voltaire gave him
so much pleasure as that simple answer.</p>

<p>Nor was the case of Callas the only one in which
he took an active interest. A man called Sirven was
persecuted in much the same way, and would have
suffered a similar fate had he not escaped. It took
nine years for justice to be done this time, and Voltaire
was seventy-seven when the case was retried and<span class="pagenum">165</span>
the accused declared innocent. Further, there was
the case of Espinasse, who was sentenced to the galleys
for giving supper and a bed to a Protestant minister;
of Montbailli, who was falsely accused of murdering
his mother; of La Barre; and several others, who for
one reason or another were victims of persecution.
Voltaire’s hatred of injustice had always been strong.
He showed it when he was a much younger man. One
occasion was the death of Adrienne Lecouvreur, the
great actress, who had performed in several of his
plays. Because she was an actress she was refused
Christian burial. His fury knew no bounds, more
especially as he had seen an actress buried in London
with every mark of respect and sympathy. He wrote
a poem which showed the depths of his indignation
at this senseless intolerance.</p>

<p>Voltaire’s finest qualities, in fact, came to the front
in his character of champion of the persecuted. The
cynical satirist was merged into the generous and
courageous upholder of justice. The oppressed and
needy may get sympathy from others who are in like
condition, but it is much more rare for one who is
neither poor nor downtrodden to give them not only
sympathy, but practical and useful support.</p>

<p>Voltaire, as already said, detested intolerance. He
expressed this in a well-known phrase, which he repeated
both in his writings and in his conversation,
“<i>Écrasez l’infâme</i>” (Crush the infamous). His enemies
declared that he meant God, Christ, Christianity,<span class="pagenum">166</span>
and religion. But this was very far from true. By
<i>l’infâme</i> he meant intolerance, bigotry, superstition,
persecution, and all the hideous evils that blighted
the true spirit of religion. It was <i>l’infâme</i> that enforced
the doctrines of religion by fire, torture, and
imprisonment, it was <i>l’infâme</i> that encouraged oppression
and tyranny; it was <i>l’infâme</i> that was
the barrier to liberty, progress, and enlightenment;
and <i>l’infâme</i> was Voltaire’s lifelong enemy. He
did as much as any one to combat this evil spirit. But
it requires more than a man, it requires a people, to
succeed completely; and no people have even yet got
the power in any land. Voltaire was certainly not a
sentimentalist, and it is interesting to note that he
was the first influential writer who was struck more by
the futility than the cruelty of war. He regarded
both war and the intrigues of diplomacy which create
it as being absolutely contrary to the best interests
of nations.</p>

<p>It is a pity Voltaire ever left Ferney. However,
he very naturally wanted to revisit Paris, which he
had not seen for twenty-eight years. Also he wanted
to superintend the production of a new tragedy he
had just written. Madame Denis, who was bored with
Ferney, seems to have encouraged him to go. Instead,
therefore, of dying quietly in his home, he
passed the last few weeks of his life in a perfect orgy
of entertainment and excitement, and there is something
pathetic in the vain little old man, masquerad<span class="pagenum">167</span>ing
for the benefit of Paris crowds. And yet his last
visit to Paris, which amounted to an event of public
importance, was very characteristic of the man’s whole
life. He received all sorts of distinguished visitors;
society flocked to see him; the French Academy, by
whom in old days he had been rejected, paid him every
compliment possible; actors welcomed him with enthusiasm;
the middle-class turned out in crowds to
see him; the Protestants worshiped the man who had
fought against persecution; the mob filled the streets
in awe of a man who could stand up so boldly against
the powers of government; the Court and the Church
avoided him because they feared him, while the
preachers denounced him from their pulpits.</p>

<p>One of his oldest friends was greeted by him on his
arrival with the words, “I have left off dying to come
and see you.” The Academy’s reception was a great
function. A gorgeous coach was sent for him, and
as the crowd waited he appeared in the doorway, a
very lean figure, with his old-fashioned gray wig surmounted
by a little square cap. He wore a red coat
lined with ermine, white silk stockings on his shrunken
legs, large silver buckles on his shoes, a little cane
in his hand with a crow’s beak for a handle, and over
all this wonderful dress, a sable cloak which had been
given to him by Catherine, Empress of Russia. At
the Louvre two thousand people assembled, and
greeted him with shouts of “Long live Voltaire!”
Afterwards, at the theater, he appeared in a box, and<span class="pagenum">168</span>
the whole audience rose and received him with frantic
applause. An actor came forward and crowned him
with a wreath of laurels, while the people stormed
and shouted. It certainly was a triumph, a remarkable triumph,
not only for the man, but for his opinions.
There was no discordant voice. As one who
was present said, “Envy, hatred, fanaticism, and intolerance
dared not murmur.”</p>

<p>But all these entertainments were too much for the
old man. He grew more feeble and ill, and died at
last on May 30, 1778, at the age of eighty-three.
Shortly before his death Voltaire signed a declaration
which summed up his belief: “I die worshiping God,
loving my friends, and not hating my enemies, but
detesting superstition.” His body, dressed up as
though he were alive, was taken out of Paris in a
carriage and buried at Scellières, about a hundred
miles away. The bishops of the diocese sent an order
to forbid the burial, but it was too late. No newspaper
was allowed to mention his death or anything
about him, and the Academy was forbidden to hold
the service which was customary on the death of a
member. In the twentieth century just the same orders
were issued by the Russian Government when
Tolstoy died. Nothing is feared more by Church and
State than the influence of a great reformer.</p>

<p>Over Voltaire’s body controversy raged just as it
had over the living man.</p>

<p>On the eve of the French Revolution the National<span class="pagenum">169</span>
Assembly of France made Louis XVI sign a decree
ordering Voltaire’s remains to be transferred to Paris.
This was done with great pomp and ceremony. A long
procession with banners and music passed through
the city. An immense sarcophagus, forty feet high,
surmounted by a full-length figure of Voltaire and
a winged figure of Immortality, was drawn along by
twelve white horses. On it was written, “He avenged
Callas, La Barre, Sirven, and Montbailli. Poet, philosopher,
historian, he gave a great impulse to the
human mind; he prepared us to become free.” A hundred
thousand people walked in the procession
through crowds of hundreds of thousands more. The
body was buried in the Panthéon. But this was not
its last resting-place. In 1814, on the restoration of
the Bourbon Kings, his bones were removed and
thrown into a waste place outside the city. This was
discovered in 1864, when his heart, which had been in
the possession of the Villette family, was placed inside
the empty tomb.</p>

<p>It has been impossible to enumerate even Voltaire’s
principal writings, but mention must be made of one
of the most remarkable of his works, which was his
“Philosophical Dictionary.” It contained brief articles
on an enormous variety of subjects, each one
brimful of interest, whether they were treated with
serious thought and profound learning or with sarcasm
and biting irony. He kept on adding to it until
it reached eight volumes, and, needless to say, it<span class="pagenum">170</span>
shocked and infuriated as well as delighted those
who read it. He also assisted with many contributions
to the great encyclopædia which Diderot and
d’Alembert helped to compile, and which created a
great stir and exercised a considerable influence on
the contemporary thought of France.</p>

<p>Madame du Deffand, one of the many brilliant
women of eighteenth-century France, who knew Voltaire
well and corresponded with him for many years,
said of him that “he was good to read and bad to
know.” His faults were certainly very marked, and
to some extent spoilt his virtues. His vanity was
almost ridiculous; he was quite unscrupulous in making
money, in attacking his enemies, and in defending
himself; he scoffed with cruel and bitter words,
but he never mocked at any men who lived good lives.
Mischief prompted him more than malice. He could
not help laughing at people who pulled long faces and
were incapable of laughing at themselves.</p>

<p>He certainly disbelieved in the creeds of the Church;
but by partaking, on one occasion, of the Communion,
building a church, and joining a religious order, it
looked as if he were insincere, though he is not the
only person who has conformed to religious observances
in which he did not really believe. But Voltaire
scandalized people by doing it all with his tongue
in his cheek; in fact, he was altogether irreverent by
nature, and reverence is a quality which the strongest
opponent of any creed ought always to display. Grant<span class="pagenum">171</span>ing
all these defects, however, Voltaire’s influence in
opening men’s minds, showing up what was false,
sham, and hypocritical, was quite immeasurable. He
had, too, the great virtue of humanity. This is not
just sentimental kindness and empty sympathy, but,
as John Morley expresses it, “Humanity armed, aggressive,
and alert; never slumbering and never wearying;
moving like an ancient hero, over the land to slay
monsters, is the rarest of virtues, and Voltaire is one
of its master types.”</p>

<p>A great upheaval was not far off, and gradually
the way was being prepared for a better day in France
and in Europe. Another man was at work, Jean
Jacques Rousseau, whom Voltaire knew, but did not
like. While Voltaire was appealing to the minds of
the thoughtful, Rousseau was reading the hearts of
the people and stirring their imagination. The age
was one of extreme corruption, frivolity, and luxury
on one side, and poverty, degradation, and misery on
the other: an age of bad laws, stale traditions, and
reckless cruelty. Voltaire and his friends were sowing
the seeds of revolt. The people, only half-conscious,
were being driven, as they so easily can
be in any country where they are kept ignorant, partly
by circumstances, partly by weak men, and partly
by an atrocious social system, into the precipice of
disaster.</p>

<p>The crash came in the great French Revolution, the
greatest convulsion through which any country has<span class="pagenum">172</span>
ever passed. With all its bloodshed and violent excesses,
and in spite of the reaction which quickly followed
it in the rise of Napoleon, the Revolution
finally destroyed a disastrous method of government,
and freed the people from the worst forms of oppression
which had grown up in the long reigns of Louis
XIV and Louis XV. Voltaire did not live to see this
tremendous change; he would have deplored its violence,
but his responsibility for the growth of the
ideas which made such a thing possible was by no
means small.</p>

<h2>VIII<br /><br />

HANS ANDERSEN<br /><br />

1805–1875</h2>


<p><small>It matters not to have been born in a duck-yard, if one has been
hatched from a swan’s egg.</small><br /><br /></p>


<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is the story of Hans Andersen, the son of a
poor cobbler and his wife a washerwoman. Nearly
every child in the world has read his Fairy Stories,
and the romance of his own life is almost as marvelous
as one of these—more marvelous, perhaps, because
it is really true. All the things he dreamt of—all
the things he longed to happen, came true, so that
when he was fifty he wrote it down and called it
“The Story of My Life.”</p>

<p>Hans Andersen was born rather more than a hundred
years ago in the ancient city of Odense, in Denmark.
His parents were very poor, so poor that they
had only one room under a steep gabled roof. In this
room, which was kitchen, workshop, parlor, and bedroom,
Hans Andersen opened his eyes, to the sound
of his father hammering shoes. He was born in a
great bed with curtains—which had been made by
his father out of a nobleman’s coffin; there were bits<span class="pagenum">174</span>
of ragged crape still hanging about the woodwork of
the bed. The little room which was Hans’ home was
to him exciting and delightful beyond measure. It
was full of all sorts of things—the walls were covered
with pictures, and the tables and chests had shiny
cups and glasses and jugs upon them. The room was
always decorated with fresh birch and beech boughs,
and bunches of sweet herbs hung from the rafters.
In the lattice window grew pots of mint. Close to the
window was the cobbler’s workshop and a shelf of
books. The door was painted with rough landscapes,
and when the little boy was in bed he would gaze at
these and make up stories about them. His father
and mother, before they came to bed, would say to
one another in low voices how nice and quiet Hans
was, believing him to be asleep—when he was really
wide awake enjoying his own thoughts and fancies
about the pictures. Between the Andersens’ cottage
and their neighbor’s there stood a box of earth, which
Andersen’s mother planted with chives and parsley.
This was their garden, and you can read about it in
the “Snow Queen.” As Hans grew up he thought
there was nothing so nice in the world as his own
little home, and he loved to beautify it with garlands
of flowers and wild plants, which he would put about
in glasses. He was very fond of his mother, who
was not, it seems, a particularly attractive woman.
She was good-natured, but silly and thriftless, never
thinking of the morrow so long as they had a roof
<span class="pagenum">175</span>over their heads that day. She was careless, too,
about Hans as an infant, and was in the truest sense
of the word uneducated. Hans got his love of reading
and his imagination from his unsuccessful, unhappy
father. The cobbler was a far more educated person
than his wife, and he was better born. But owing
to his family’s misfortunes—for they had come down
in the world—he was obliged, much against his will,
to take up shoemaking; this work he settled down to
with a sad and bitter heart. All his spare time he
gave to reading. Books became his one comfort. He
was never seen to smile except when he was reading.
Sometimes he would read aloud in the evenings and
his wife would gaze at him completely puzzled—not
understanding, but admiring him all the same.</p>

<img src="images/i_fp174.jpg" width="500" height="610" alt="HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN" /></a>
<div class="caption">HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN</div>
</div>

<p>As Hans grew older, he and his father became great
friends, and they went long walks together; and while
his father sat and thought or read, Hans ran about
picking wild strawberries and making pretty garlands
of flowers. The cobbler certainly rather neglected his
shoemaking, and as he was different from his neighbors,
they shunned him and thought all sorts of evil
things about him. The cobbler’s one wish was to get
away from the city and to live in the country. On
hearing one day that the squire of a large village required
a shoemaker about the place, he offered himself
as such. Then he would have a cottage and a
little garden and perhaps a cow. The squire’s wife
sent him a piece of silk to make a specimen of dancing<span class="pagenum">176</span>
shoes. For the next few days the family could talk of
nothing else but these shoes and of their hopes for the
future. Hans prayed to God to fulfil his father’s
wishes. At last the shoes were finished and were
gazed upon with admiration by Hans and his mother.
Off went the cobbler with the shoes wrapped up in
his apron—while his little family waited in impatience
and anxiety at home. When the cobbler returned his
face was quite pale and they saw something dreadful
had happened. He told them the squire’s wife had
not even tried on the shoes. She had just looked at
them, and said the silk was spoiled and that she would
not require him as shoemaker. The cobbler then and
there took out his knife and cut the poor shoes in
pieces. So all their hopes were dashed to the ground;
their rosy hopes of a life in the country with a cow
and a garden faded like a dream, and they wept.</p>

<p>Hans Andersen as a child had no boy friends, and
he hardly did any lessons, but he was very far from
being bored, because he had such a lively imagination
and could always invent games and stories for
himself. His father would make him toys, pictures
that changed their shapes when pulled with a string,
and a mill which made the miller dance when it went
round, and peep-shows of funny rag dolls. What he
liked best was making dolls’ clothes. In the little
garden he would sit for hours near the one gooseberry-bush.
This, with the help of a broomstick and his<span class="pagenum">177</span>
mother’s apron, he made into a little tent, and there
he would sit in all weathers, fancying things and inventing
stories. Very occasionally he went to a school,
and at one school he made friends with a little girl
and would tell her stories. They were mostly about
himself—how he was of noble birth only the fairies
had changed him in his cradle, and all sorts of other
inventions. One day he heard the little girl say, “He
is a fool like his grandpapa,” and poor Hans trembled
and never spoke to her about these things again. He
had a mad old grandfather at the lunatic asylum,
where he sometimes went. His grandmother, the
mother of his father, was a dear old lady who looked
after the garden of the asylum, and brought flowers
to the Andersens every Sunday. She would recount
to Hans stories of her youth—of her mother’s mother,
who had been quite a grand lady, and of her own
happy childhood in more prosperous circumstances.
Strange sights Hans would see in the court at the
asylum, sights that would haunt him for days and
even years, so that he would beg his parents to put
him in their big bed and draw the curtains that he
might feel safe. He grew up religious in a sort of
superstitious way, and this was his mother’s influence.
He was shocked at his father, as his mother and
the neighbors were—“there is no other devil than
that which is in our own hearts,” said his father one
day, and Andersen’s mother burst into tears and<span class="pagenum">178</span>
prayed to God to forgive his father. The cobbler died
when Hans was only eleven years old, and he was
left alone with his mother.</p>

<p>He continued to play with his toy theater and peep-shows
and made dolls’ clothes. But he also read all
he could lay hands on, and a great deal of Shakespeare,
which made a deep impression on him. He
liked best the plays where there are ghosts and
witches—he felt he must go on the stage. He jotted
down at this time the titles of twenty-five plays; the
spelling of the titles being most peculiar!</p>

<p>Naturally young Hans Andersen was the laughing-stock
of the neighborhood. Nobody understood him,
and Hans singing in the lanes and sewing and reading
at home was simply regarded as a lunatic. By
the time he was fourteen he had not a single friend
of his own age. Boys teased him, and screamed at
him, “There goes the play scribbler,” so that Hans
shrank from them and would hide himself at home
from their mocking eyes and voices. He longed, like
the ugly duckling of his story, for the companionship
of people cleverer and nobler than himself.</p>

<p>He was indeed very funny to look at, quite comically
ugly with his large nose and feet and very small
Japanese eyes, and he was so tall and gawky that his
clothes were always too small for him, which made
him look still odder. He became persuaded that his
voice was going to make his fortune, and an old woman
who washed clothes in the river told Andersen that<span class="pagenum">178</span>
the Empire of China lay under the water there. Hans
quite believed her. He thought to himself that perhaps
one moonlight night, when he would be singing
by the water’s edge, a Chinese Prince might push
his way through the earth on hearing his song, and
would take him down into his country and there make
him rich and noble. Then he might let him visit
Odense again, where he would live and build a castle,
the envied and admired of everybody. Long after—Andersen
says in his autobiography—when he was
reading his poems and stories aloud in Copenhagen,
he hoped for such a Prince to appear in the audience
who would sympathize and help him.</p>

<p>But the gentry, though much amused by the cobbler’s
peculiar son, were sorry for him. He seemed
to them a strange and freakish being, who, though he
could recite plays from memory and make poetry, was
yet so ignorant that he knew no grammar, or even how
to spell. They laughed at Hans’ absurdly ambitious
and childish ideas, that he was at once going to be
a great writer, or singer, or actor, without any education
at all. One family tried their best to get him
into the local school, or to enter some trade, but he
would not hear of it. He was, however, sent to the
ragged school for a time to learn scripture, writing,
and arithmetic. They found he could hardly write a
line correctly, and he was dreadfully bored by this
sort of learning. He must have been an annoying
pupil, for he was always dreamy and absent-minded,<span class="pagenum">180</span>
and never looked at his lessons except on his way to
and from school. He tried to please the master by
bringing him bunches of wild flowers. He left the
school as ignorant as he had entered it. At about
the age of fourteen he was confirmed, and wore for
the first time a pair of boots—of these he was so tremendously
proud that when he walked up the aisle of
the church he drew his trousers right up so that every
one might see the boots, and he rejoiced that they
squeaked so loudly that every one’s attention might
be drawn to them—at the same time he felt he ought
not to be thinking so much of his boots and so little
of his Maker. The story of the Red Shoes was inspired
by them. Naturally his relations began to get
a little anxious about this time as to his future. He
was fourteen and he had not yet done anything sensible,
and was what ordinary people would call a dunce.
He had, it is true, shown extraordinary skill with
his needle, and this pointed to his being a tailor.
While his relations talked and worried over Hans
together and came to no conclusion the boy continued
his desultory life. But he had great schemes in his
head, and was making up his mind to take his fate
into his own hands. He would, like the heroes he
had read about, set out by himself to seek his fortune.
This meant that he would go to Copenhagen and there
find work at the Theater. This idea had come to him
when the actors from the Royal Theater there had
come to Odense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">181</span></p>

<p>Andersen had one day got permission to appear
on the stage as a shepherd. His enthusiasm and funny
childish ways amused and interested the actors, and
Hans at once thought he was a born actor and that
his fortune was made. He heard these same actors
speak about a thing called a Ballet, which seemed to
be finer than anything in the world, and of a wonderful
lady who danced in the Ballet, and Hans pictured
her as a sort of fairy queen who would help him and
make him famous. His mother was rather alarmed
at these plans, but Hans said in answer to her objections,
“You go through a frightful lot of hardships,
and then you become famous.” So the mother
consulted a wise woman, who, examining the coffee
grouts, said that Hans Christian Andersen would become
a great man, and that one day Odense would be
illuminated in his honor. Hans’ mother was then
quite satisfied. The boy packed up his little bundle
to take him to the ship, and so to Copenhagen. He
had about nine dollars in his pocket, and was fourteen
years old. Most people would say what a mad
expedition and how absurd, but Hans had no fear,
he was happy, for he had his wish, and was quite sure
that he would make his fortune.</p>

<p>When he arrived at Copenhagen he rushed off to
see the Fairy Queen, the dancer he had heard about,
and told her how he wished to go on the stage. To
show her what he could do, he took off his boots and
made a drum out of his hat, and so began to dance<span class="pagenum">182</span>
and sing. As he had such a very odd appearance,
his heavy elephantine gambols simply terrified the
poor lady, she took him for an escaped lunatic, and of
course showed him the door.</p>

<p>But Hans Andersen, still hopeful, went off to the
Director of the Theater, and there met with another
rebuff. He was told that only educated people were
engaged for the stage. This was hard to bear, and
after various adventures and disappointments Hans
found he had only fifty cents left—so either he must
return to Odense by the first coasting ship, or stop
at Copenhagen and learn a trade. He chose a trade,
and apprenticed himself to a joiner, but there the
roughness and coarse talk of his fellow-joiners upset
him so much that he left the same day. So there he
was, friendless and with nothing to do but to wander
the streets. In his wanderings, he suddenly remembered
the name of a man he had heard the Odense
people talk about, a musician, the Director of the
Conservatoire. So off he went to this man’s house,
with the purpose of asking him to take him as a
pupil. When he arrived he found the musician was
having a dinner-party, but Andersen was allowed in,
and telling them of his object he was taken to the
piano, and there played and recited. When he had
finished, he burst into tears, but the company applauded
and raised a small collection of money for
him. The kind musician arranged that he should
<span class="pagenum">183</span>
have lessons in singing, and Hans, full of joy, wrote
to his mother that his fortune was in sight.</p>

<p>For the next nine months he was supported by
these “noble-minded men,” as he called them, but
when he lost his voice about the age of fifteen, they
advised him to return to his native town and learn
a handicraft, but rather than do this the poor boy
was ready to endure every hardship. He lived now
in a garret in the lowest quarter of Copenhagen, and
had nothing to eat but a cup of coffee in the morning
and a roll eaten on a bench later in the day. He
was very proud and sensitive, so he would pretend
that he had had plenty to eat and that he had been
dining out with friends, also that he was quite warm,
when his clothes were absolutely threadbare and
patched, and his wretched boots let in all the wet,
so that his feet were sometimes not dry for weeks.
When he lay down to sleep in his attic, he tells us,
after saying his prayers, he was helped by his trust
in God that everything would turn out right in the
end; and indeed it was almost miraculous the way
something or somebody always turned up to help.</p>

<p>Kind-hearted people taught him German and Danish,
and sent him to the dancing school to learn
dancing, but they did not give him money, because
they had no idea how poor he was, as he said nothing
about it. The courage and determination he showed at
this time were really remarkable in so young a boy,
<span class="pagenum">184</span>
and in spite of being very nearly starved he continued
to write poems and plays. One play he sent to the
Royal Theater without giving his name, and never
doubted in his childish ignorance that it would be
accepted. It was sent back to him with a curt note
saying that the play showed such a lack of education
that it was absurd. But the only effect this had on
Andersen was to make him write another, and he sent
that to the manager of the theater; but this time those
who read it said it showed unmistakable signs of talent,
and advised that Andersen’s friends should ask
the King to help with money to support and educate
the boy. Frederick VI of Denmark was like the kind
kings in Andersen’s stories. He arranged at once
that Hans should be sent to the Latin School at
Slagelse for three years, to be properly educated and
cared for. This was arranged and Hans went off to
school, but his time there was not at all happy.</p>

<p>The adventurous, free life he led in Copenhagen,
though he had been hungry and cold, had been much
more to his liking. In the story of his life he writes
about this period with the greatest bitterness. He
had been so happy at the prospect of learning, and
when he got to school, he felt like a wild bird shut
up in a cage. “I behaved,” he said, “like one who
is thrown into the water without being able to swim.
It was a matter of life and death to me to make progress,
but there came one billow after another—one
called Mathematics, another called Grammar, another
<span class="pagenum">185</span>
called Geography—and I began to fear I should never
swim through them all.” He was terribly frightened
of failing, and began to think he was a dunce, for
he was seventeen and had to be put with the smallest
boys in the school, which was very discouraging, but
it was greatly the master’s fault. He treated Hans
as he would ninety-nine boys out of a hundred. He
never ceased laughing at him, and seldom, if ever, encouraged
him; so damping was he that Andersen
really began to feel he was not worth all the trouble
and money that were being spent upon him. Andersen,
with his sensitive, imaginative nature, was apt
to make mountains out of molehills. His imagination,
indeed, was quite extraordinary, extravagant, and out
of proportion to his other faculties. He needed a
kind, understanding person to guide him, but he was
left to himself and had few, if any, friends. The
ordinary dull routine of school life made him suffer.
He describes it all in his book as a sort of “Dotheboys
Hall,” when it was really just an ordinary school
like any other at that date. His anxiety to get on
may be guessed at when we read that he nearly worried
himself to death, because he got “Very good”
in a report for conduct, instead of “Remarkably
good.” “I am a strange being,” he once wrote. “If
the wind blows a wee bit sharply the water always
comes into my eyes, though I know very well that life
cannot be a perpetual May day.”</p>

<p>When he was twenty his master moved to Elsinore,
<span class="pagenum">186</span>
and Andersen went with him. He was pleased and
excited at the change; the beautiful country round
Elsinore filled him with joy; but, alas! he got on
still less well with his master, who treated him, Andersen
says, as a perfectly stupid, brutish boy. At
that period it was considered the right thing for
schoolmasters, and even parents, never to praise a
child or encourage him for fear of spoiling him. Yet
all the time this master was scolding and laughing
at Hans, he was writing to the boy’s friends, praising
his nature, his warm heart and imagination, and his
diligence in work. He recommended him as worthy
of any support in the way of money or education
that might be given him. One day Andersen brought
his master a poem he had written, and the man
scoffed and said it was mere idle trash, and only fit
for the rubbish-heap. This quite finished Hans; he
was found by another master in deep distress. The
same master told Andersen’s friends of the boy’s unhappiness
and advised his removal. He was taken
away. So ended what Andersen describes as the
“darkest and bitterest period of my life.” He had
been at school a little more than three years.</p>

<p>Andersen now became a student at Copenhagen.
He worked hard and conscientiously, but was always
stupid at examinations, and at Latin and Greek. In
his spare time he wrote poems, plays, and sketches,
and published his first considerable book called “A
Journey on Foot from Holmen’s Canal to the East
<span class="pagenum">187</span>
Point of Amager.” This strange volume is such a
confused jumble of things that it is rather like a
dream. But even in the jumble you can see Andersen’s
gift, in the little fairy-like touches and the beautiful
descriptions of nature and of seasons. The
Danes liked the book, for rather childish and fantastic
things amuse them. Most of Andersen’s work,
however, was pronounced to be wishy-washy and silly
by the critics, and Andersen failed and failed again;
yet he never gave up trying and never apparently lost
belief in his own talent. Still he got very cast down
and unhappy, and felt that he must get away and
have a complete change. The same kind King who
had helped him with his education, then allowed him
money for foreign travel, and Andersen went off for
a long spell abroad—to Italy, to France, and to Germany.</p>

<p>Away from his own country he got great inspiration,
he says, and started by writing a novel which
he was certain would take the world by storm. It
was a most bitter blow that when the book was published
every one laughed at it, and the reviews which
reached him abroad pronounced it to be dull, sentimental,
and unreal. But Andersen had made up his
mind that he would be either a great novelist or a
great dramatist; so on he went, writing with his
usual persistence and courage. He did at last succeed
in bringing out a successful novel.</p>

<p>So immediate was its success that the author’s
<span class="pagenum">188</span>
reputation seemed made. This type of novel, which
is very romantic and very impossible, would not be
appreciated nowadays; but again its charm lay in
its descriptions of scenery and places. Andersen was
delighted, and at once made up his mind that he was
to be one of the greatest novelists the world had ever
seen. But this was not to be, for except for one or
two rather beautiful books of travel, his serious books
were not great, and were not to make him famous.</p>

<p>Now Andersen had a talent which he did not take
seriously himself, and if it had not been for his friends,
perhaps the world would never have known of it.</p>

<p>When Hans Andersen was in a good humor and
wanted to keep children quiet and amused—nicely
behaved and nice-looking children they had to be—he
used to tell them fairy tales. Odense, his birthplace,
was a home of legends, and folk stories he
had heard as a child stuck in his memory. These
he wove into stories in the most wonderful manner.
He had a peculiar way of telling these stories which
simply delighted children. He never in telling them
troubled about grammar; he would use childish words
and baby language. Then he would act and jump
about and make the most comic faces. Nobody who
had not heard him could guess how lively and amusing
these stories were; but it never seemed to strike
Andersen that he might write them down: he did not
think them worth it. When some one suggested that
he might write them down and print them, so that
<span class="pagenum">189</span>
they should be known by other people, not only his
own small circle of friends, Andersen laughed at the
idea, but decided to do it just for fun. He would
write them down as he told them. Now this is easier
said than done, for when you begin to put pen to
paper your inclination is to write a thing like an
essay and not as if you were talking to somebody.
Yet what you feel when you read Hans Andersen’s
stories is just this, that they are told and not written.
He printed first a tiny volume, and called it
“Fairy Tales as Told to Children”; it cost ten cents.
In this volume were “The Tinder Box,” “Little Claus
and Big Claus,” and “Little Ida’s Flowers,” and this
was followed by a second part with “Thumbeline”
and “The Traveling Companion,” and then a third
number appeared containing “The Emperor’s New
Clothes” and “The Little Mermaid.” The three
parts made the first volume of his tales.</p>

<p>Andersen still refused to take these “small things,”
as he called them, seriously. He was certainly not
encouraged by the critics, for they were too stupid
and conventional to see the point of these tales. Some
were too grand even to look at them, and some were
shocked. One wrote that no child should be allowed
to read “The Tinder Box,” for it wasn’t at all nice
that a Princess should ride on a dog’s back, and be
kissed by a soldier. Hans Andersen was advised by
these dense people not to waste any more time on such
things. There was also much scolding about the con<span class="pagenum">190</span>versational
style of the writing. It was quite unlike
the heavy, pompous stuff people were accustomed to
at that date. “This is not the way people write,”
it was said, “this is not grammar.” But there were
people who saw at once the beauty of these stories,
who declared that they would make Andersen immortal.</p>

<p>Andersen himself did not trouble much about it one
way or the other; he still thought about the success
of his novel, and made plans for writing another with
Napoleon as his hero. He would compel people to
see what a great dramatist and novelist he was. He
wrote and translated many operettas and plays. One
was produced at the Royal Theater with great success.
It was a poor play but well acted, and containing
some noble sentiments; it pleased the honest
Danes. But the Fairy Tales went on appearing at
intervals, and found their way into most Danish
homes. In fact, they were building up Hans Andersen’s
reputation for him all over the world. Andersen
soon found that he had great admirers among
children, and there were very few nurseries where
they didn’t know the stories by heart. Perhaps his
own country had not been quite so eager about them
as some others—Germany and Sweden, and even England,
which is supposed to be slow and conservative
about new things, were very enthusiastic. When Andersen
visited England at the age of forty-three, he
found he was quite a lion. Great ladies would re<span class="pagenum">191</span>peat
his stories from memory, and he was asked out
to breakfasts, teas, and dinners, to meet other important
people of the day. He was delighted, because
he loved to be appreciated. Dickens was specially
kind to him and asked Andersen to stay with
him. Andersen wrote about England to his friends
in Denmark: “Here I am regarded as a Danish
Walter Scott, while in Denmark I am supposed to
be a sort of third-class author.” He fumed and fretted
in quite a childish way that the Danish papers did
not pay more attention to his reception in England;
it made him feel quite ill, he says.</p>

<p>So after writing an immense poem and another
novel, which both failed, he devoted himself to the
Fairy Tales.</p>

<p>Andersen in his own “Life” says about his Fairy
Tales, that he would willingly have given up writing
them, but that they forced themselves upon him. He
knew that the critics would object to the style of
the writing, and that was why, at the beginning, he
had called the stories “Fairy Tales for Children,”
but he had meant them as much for the grown-ups.
He found that people of different ages were equally
amused by them—the older ones by the deeper meaning,
and children by the fancies, so like their own,
and the amusing, lively style of the writing. Indeed,
Andersen’s great gift is that he appeals to so many
different sorts of people, that he himself has so many
sides. He is tender, sad, and wistful, but also absurd,<span class="pagenum">192</span>
fantastic, and amusing. At one moment he makes
us cry, the next instant we laugh. Andersen had been
able to keep the imagination of a child of five or six,
though he was a grown-up man of over thirty when
he began to publish his stories. He saw through a
child’s eyes, and never felt any difficulty in imagining
all the playthings coming alive. He does not, for one
thing, distinguish between things and persons. He
makes inanimate things human, and he does it without
any effort or apparent stretching of the imagination.
It seems quite the most ordinary thing in the
world, when Andersen tells us about it, that an inkpot
should talk with a pen, and that flowers, dolls,
earwigs, beetles, clouds, and the necks of bottles
should all converse with one another, and have their
special personalities. He could write about anything,
and the telling of utterly improbable things quite simply
and naturally, is one of his great gifts. “Tell
us a story about a darning-needle,” said the Danish
sculptor Thorwaldsen, who was never tired of hearing
him; and that was how the story came to be written.
“I am not a fellow, I am a young lady,” said the
darning-needle, and how could a darning-needle be
anything else?</p>

<p>Many incidents of Andersen’s curious childhood inspired
his stories as well as folk-lore. Beautifully
as he has adapted legends—such as the “Wild
Swans” and the “Swineherd”—his own inventions
are, I think, the best of all. What more lovely and<span class="pagenum">193</span>
touching story can be imagined than the “Little Mermaid,”
or more charming than “Thumbeline”? In
the “Little Mermaid,” and that thrilling “Story of
the Traveling Companion,” we seem to see the author’s
great belief in good, in love, and self-sacrifice; yet he
never points a moral or annoys by preaching. That
was the last thing he could be; he was much too aware
of his own failings to think of lecturing other people
about theirs, even in a story. Some of his heroes play
the most shocking pranks, such as the soldier in “The
Tinder Box,” who kills an old woman; and Little
Claus’ behavior is rather odd; yet they never seem
to meet with any retribution. On the contrary, they
thrive exceedingly.</p>

<p>Andersen had a great gift of satire, which in some
cases may be rather bitter and unkind, but in Andersen’s
it could not possibly offend people. He laughs
at the world, and at people’s foibles in such an amused,
kindly spirit, though he does show up most clearly
the absurdity and emptiness of such things as riches
and power, which believe that everything is within
their grasp. “The Little Nightingale” and “The Emperor’s
New Clothes,” are examples of this sort of
story.</p>

<p>In the world that Andersen writes about—a world
of children, birds, flowers, supernatural beings, and
friendly kings—ugly, sordid, unsatisfactory things
have no place. Andersen himself could never really
face the ugly and cruel, he could not even write or<span class="pagenum">194</span>
talk about them; so that this delicate talent of his
was not the one to make him write good books about
real life, for in the world there are both good and
bad. His plays and novels were not true to life; they
were sentimental and boring, and only when Andersen
has been able to describe nature in his novels does
his poetic talent shine through.</p>

<p>Plants were Andersen’s favorite things, as anyone
can see who reads “The Fir Tree,” “Little Ida’s
Flowers,” or “The Snow Queen.” “Flowers know
that I love them,” he said. He likened them to sleeping
children, for he loved simplicity and unconsciousness.
Only in the vegetable world he felt was there
complete peace and harmony, without any jarring element.
When he saw a fallen tree he felt he must
weep, and when the buds began to swell in the spring,
he would laugh aloud for joy. After flowers, Andersen
loved birds better than four-footed animals, and
then children. I suppose some people might be
shocked at this. He didn’t love children in the mass;
there are, after all, nice and nasty children; but he
had great friends among them.</p>

<p>When he was old, his admirers in Denmark put up
a statue to him in Copenhagen, showing him as an
old man with uplifted finger and a smiling face, surrounded
by a host of children. It sounds all right
to those who didn’t know Andersen. Well, he was
quite cross about it, and said he didn’t feel like that
at all. It was annoying to have himself represented<span class="pagenum">195</span>
as “a venerable, toothless old man, with a pack of
children crowding round,” as he expressed it.</p>

<p>Andersen, by the time he was middle-aged, was
celebrated over a great part of the world. He was
fashionable in his own town of Copenhagen, and people
would nudge one another in the street as he passed,
saying, “There goes the Poet.” Actresses recited his
stories, and he himself read them aloud at parties,
which would be considered very great occasions. In
some ways it sounds rather trying. He had a way
of reading his favorites over and over again, and demanding
absolute attention; the ladies must stop knitting,
the gentlemen must cease to smoke. In spite
of these rules and regulations his extraordinary way
of reading, his charming voice, his faces and antics,
astonished and interested his audience so much that
they put up with anything, and would have been willing
to stand on their heads, if he had asked them to.</p>

<p>Andersen was made very happy by success, and he
says in his “Life,” that it made up to him for all the
hard words the critics had spoken. “There came
within me,” he says, “a sense of rest, a feeling that
all, even the bitter in my life, had been needful for
my development and fortune.”</p>

<p>It was a constant source of wonder and delight to
him to find himself where he was. He, the son of a
poor cobbler and a washerwoman, who had run about
as a child in wooden shoes, now to be treated by the
most important people as their equal, and to enjoy<span class="pagenum">196</span>
the best that the world can give. He was friends with
princes, and kings were as fathers to him. On his
travels, which were like fairy tale travels, he found
himself welcomed in every drawing-room of every capital
in Europe. He met Dumas and Victor Hugo in
France; in Germany, Heine, the brothers Grimm, and
Mendelssohn and Schumann; and Dickens, as we
know, in England. And he didn’t meet these people
in a stiff, formal way, but in their dressing-gowns,
so to speak. His childlike nature drew people to him,
and he was friendly and intimate with them at once.
All these things appeared to him more marvelous even
than the most fantastic incidents of his own fairy
tales. He would often, when enjoying some quite
ordinary luxury, which most people take as a matter
of course, such as lying on a sofa in a new dressing-gown
surrounded by books, think of his childhood
and wonder.</p>

<p>That Andersen should have been impressed by grandeur,
by kings and princes in their castles, and the
trappings of wealth, is quite natural. He was pleased
and amazed, as a child and as a peasant are pleased
and amazed. It appealed to his romantic imagination,
and the marvel of the contrast with his own childhood
and early manhood never ceased to delight him, and
to make him thankful. He was not a snob, for a snob
is one who despises the less fortunate, but he had a
real democratic feeling and never forgot that he was
a peasant to start with. He knew that poor people<span class="pagenum">197</span>
have just as much nobility of soul as the better off,
and he shows this in his stories. He is always pointing
out the beauty of simple, humble things; of the
things that people pass by without noticing. In a
lovely but little-known story, “The Conceited Apple
Blossom,” though it is only about flowers, you can
think of them as people, and it becomes really an
allegory on rich and poor. Andersen said about poor
people that they were as defenseless as children, and
therefore he felt specially tender toward them. When
at his literary jubilee, celebrated at Copenhagen, he
received gold snuffboxes from kings, and letters from
ladies declaring their love from all over the world, he
treasured most, four-leaved clovers sent him by peasants,
and a waistcoat made for love by an admiring
tailor.</p>

<p>Hans Andersen was very vain, and sometimes very
silly. He thirsted for praise and encouragement, all
the more so, that for so many years he had met with
nothing but contempt. Praise was to him, he says,
as necessary as sunshine and water to flowers, and
without it he perished. Praise made him feel nice,
humble, and grateful, but disagreeable criticism made
him bitter and proud. He made no effort to conceal
his vanity. If he had been praised he wanted everybody
to know about it. Once he shouted to a friend
on the other side of the street, “Well, what do you
think? I am read in Spain now. Good-by!”</p>

<p>But Hans Andersen’s character was full of con<span class="pagenum">198</span>tradictions.
Though acutely sensitive and easily dejected,
yet he was dogged, and sometimes almost pushing
in his desire to be thought a great writer. From
earliest days he had been full of enterprise and energy—the
energy of the spirit, for his health had
never been good, and had been made worse by privations.
At thirty he said he felt sixty, but at sixty
he felt younger.</p>

<p>The great Danish writer, Brandes, has written a
splendid Essay on Andersen, in which he says in
reference to him, “He who possesses talent should
also possess courage.” And Hans Andersen did possess
these, the happiest perhaps of all combinations
of qualities.</p>

<p>We may be glad to know that Hans Andersen was
not vain of his looks; indeed, he thought himself very
ugly. But he fancied that he looked distinguished.
He had his hair curled every day, and he wore very
high starched collars to hide his long neck, and very
baggy trousers to hide his legs. But in spite of this
he was always extremely odd to look at—immensely
tall and shambling, with huge feet like boats, a great
Roman nose, and almost invisible eyes. But this did
not prevent his being simply idolized by the ladies of
Denmark, several of whom wrote and asked him to
marry them!</p>

<p>The end of Andersen’s life was certainly the happiest
period. For fifteen years at least, he had enjoyed
the fact that of all Danish writers he was the<span class="pagenum">199</span>
most famous in the world. He <i>was</i> a genius, for what
he wrote was absolutely original, and peculiar to himself.
His fairy stories are beautiful inspirations with
nothing to do with education or learning.</p>

<p>Andersen was fortunate in being appreciated, and
his works were at the height of their popularity during
his lifetime. It is rather pathetic that this being
so, there should still have lingered in his mind wistful
regrets for his serious works, the unsuccessful
novels and plays. “Do you not think,” he said when
he was quite old, to a well-known English critic, “that
the people will come back to my ‘Two Baronesses’?”
(a very bad novel he wrote). Fortunately his critic
had not read the book.</p>

<p>No human being is entirely satisfied, nor should
he be, for he would then become complacent and conceited,
though in Andersen’s case, as we know, nearly
every dream of his youth came true.</p>

<p>Hans Andersen was seventy when he died. His last
days were spent happily and peacefully with some
friends in a house called “Rolighed,” which means
peace or quietude, outside Copenhagen. It overlooked
the Sound, that sheltered and beautiful bit of coast
which lies between the town of Copenhagen and the
turbulent Kattegat. From his window Andersen
could watch the ships going by like “a flock of wild
swans,” as he described it, and he could see in the
distance Tycho Brahe’s island sparkling in the sun.</p>

<p>Even when he was ill, he was able to get about the<span class="pagenum">200</span>
garden to look at the wild flowers he had planted
there, and to make his own original nosegays which
he had loved to do as a child.</p>

<p>Surrounded by the kindest and most loving friends,
he was spared all suffering and discomfort at the end,
for he had an illness which gradually weakened him
and he simply went to sleep never to wake again.
When he was dying he said very often, “How beautiful
the world is! How happy I am!”</p>

<p>It was this spirit of Andersen’s, which to the end
found beauty and joy in life, that makes his stories
so fresh and eternal. For though Hans Andersen died
a long time ago, he still lives in his writings. In
nearly all countries they are known and read. For
the truly great works of men are a gift to the whole
world, and belong to all countries and to all time. I
think these stories of Hans Andersen’s will probably
live for ever, long after we are gone—perhaps so long
as this world shall last.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> the fall of Napoleon in 1815 there was a
determination among the sovereigns of Europe to
strengthen their position and prevent any progressive
movements which might lead to a breach between the
peoples and their rulers. This was due to a fear and
dislike of the ideas which had brought about the great
Revolution in France. The Austrian Minister Metternich
was very powerful, and exercised a great influence
far beyond his own country. He was more
than conservative: he was reactionary, and did all
in his power to repress any signs of revolution. For
a time he was successful, and all opponents of established
government were treated with the greatest
severity. But he did not succeed in dispelling the
restlessness and discontent. He only drove it beneath
the surface and increased its force, so that
when it broke out it carried all before it. Ideas with<span class="pagenum">202</span>
regard to liberty, human rights, and nationality
spread rapidly, and by 1830 there were in half the
countries of Europe bodies of exasperated men who
were ready to sacrifice their lives to fight against the
injustices of autocratic rule. The consequence of this
was that two waves of revolution spread over Europe:
the first about 1830, the second in 1848, when Metternich,
finding his policy utterly defeated, fled into exile.</p>

<p>We are here concerned only with the case of Italy.
What we know now as the kingdom of Italy was formerly
divided up into many separate States. In the
north the provinces of Lombardy and Venice belonged
to Austria; Piedmont and the island of Sardinia
formed the kingdom of Sardinia; there were Grand
Dukes of Parma, Modena, and Tuscany; the Pope
ruled over the Papal States, which stretched across
the middle of Italy; and the lower part of the boot
and the island of Sicily formed the kingdom of Naples
and the two Sicilies. These States quarreled with
one another, and in many of them the people suffered
from bad government. Gradually the idea grew that
the Austrians must be driven out and a united Italy
established—one country ruled by one Government.
But it took more than forty years to accomplish this.</p>

<p>It requires three sorts of minds to bring about a
great change of this sort. The people must be educated,
and when educated their indignation must be
controlled, so that its full force may be felt at the
right moment. Those who cling to the old order of
<span class="pagenum">203</span>things must be overthrown, and the new order must
be firmly established so as to be lasting. In fact,
you want a man of ideas, a man of action, and a
statesman, not necessarily acting together, but keeping
the same object in view.</p>

<p>Italy was singularly fortunate in this respect.
There emerged at the critical period, among the many
who were ready to serve the cause, three outstanding
figures: Mazzini, the man of ideas; Garibaldi, the
man of action; and Cavour, the statesman. The man
of action and the statesman are likely to get the most
credit when the great decisive actions in the final
stages of a successful revolution take place. But the
work of the reformer, who in the earlier and more
difficult times sees a spark of light in the darkness
and proceeds patiently, with the whole weight of
public opinion against him, to preach, educate, and
prepare the ground, is certainly more difficult and in
some ways perhaps even more admirable.</p>

<p>Giuseppe Mazzini was born in Genoa in 1805. His
father was a doctor who devoted much of his time
to unpaid service of the poor, and his mother was a
woman of strong character who took a close interest
in the great political movements of the time. Giuseppe
was a studious and thoughtful boy, but delicate
in health. He noticed how his parents treated with
equal courtesy people from all ranks of life; he listened
to reminiscences of the French Republican wars
and read the praises of the democratic form of gov<span class="pagenum">204</span>ernment
in the pages of Greek and Roman history.
There was no question of conversion with him. His
sympathies grew naturally in favor of popular government
as against the rule of despotic princes. When
he was sixteen the collapse of a rising in Piedmont
made such a deep impression on him that he neglected
his lessons and insisted on dressing in black, a habit
he kept up to the end of his life.</p>

<p>To his father’s disappointment he showed himself
quite unfit to become a doctor; the very sight of an
operation made him faint. He was allowed, therefore,
to study law, and at the same time foreign literature,
history, and poetry occupied a great part of his
time. He was also very fond of music. Except on
rare occasions when he went to the theater, he spent
his evenings at home with his mother after going,
during the day, for long solitary walks. While doing
useful work as the poor man’s lawyer, he began to
write reviews and essays for the newspapers. But his
articles became so advanced in tone that two of the
newspapers to which he contributed were suppressed.</p>

<p>As a consequence of the rapid growth of discontent
against the misgovernment of the petty Sovereigns
of the States of Italy, a secret revolutionary body
had been formed, which was known as the Carbonari
(the word means “charcoal burners,” of which there
were many in the mountains of Calabria). It was
a sort of Freemasons’ Society. Mazzini disapproved
of the mysteries and theatrical forms in which the<span class="pagenum">205</span>
members indulged, but as it was the only revolutionary
organization in the country, he became a
member and swore the usual oath of initiation over
a bared dagger. He worked for them zealously, but
his intention was to form a far more vigorous association.
The Government had their eye on the Carbonari,
and Mazzini was arrested and sent to prison.
In his prison room at Savona he had much time for
reflection. He gazed upon the sky and sea and read
the only three books permitted to him, the Bible,
Byron, and Tacitus. Here it was that he thought out
the organization of a new society, the aim of which
was to be the liberation of Italy from tyranny and its
unification under a republican form of government.
This society was “Young Italy,” which became famous
throughout Europe; its motto was “God and the people.”
A further unsuccessful insurrection of the Carbonari
convinced Mazzini of the necessity of his new
scheme. When, however, he was set free, so many
restrictions were placed on his liberty that he decided
to live at Marseilles. Here, with a few others,
in one single room, he worked for two years with
the most astonishing industry.</p>

<p>His famous letter to Charles Albert, King of Sardinia,
was written from Marseilles. In it he urged
the King to take the lead in the impending struggle
for Italian independence. All over Italy a great sensation
was produced by this letter, but the Sardinian
Government was deeply offended, and his arrest was<span class="pagenum">206</span>
ordered should he cross the frontier. He also issued
the manifesto of Young Italy, and in response to it,
members joined from all parts of Italy. But a complaint
was made to the French Government, and Mazzini
was obliged to retire from Marseilles and take
refuge in Switzerland.</p>

<p>A great blow came to him which affected both his
health and his mind. His greatest friend, Jacopo
Ruffini, was one of the leaders in an unsuccessful rising
in Genoa. He was captured with several others
and executed. For a time Mazzini was dismayed,
but his unflagging energy kept him at work, and
from Geneva he organized a band of exiles which included
Germans and Poles as well as Italians, and
the invasion of Savoy was planned. Mazzini accompanied
the expedition himself, but the attack broke
down without a single shot being fired.</p>

<p>Time after time the efforts of this irrepressible enthusiast
were destined to fail. He had to work in
secret, and little by little he acquired the habit of
plotting and scheming and adopted the methods of a
conspirator. But he never lost sight of his great ideal,
and in spite of severe trials and cruel disappointments
he was able to retain in his deeply religious nature
a lofty and high-minded purpose. Mazzini was a most
striking man in appearance. Of medium height and
slightly built, his outward air of quiet melancholy
concealed an inward burning passion, which only
shone out through the fire in his eyes. He had a dark<span class="pagenum">207</span>
olive complexion, with black hair and beard. He always
wore a black, tight-fitting frock-coat, with a
black silk handkerchief round his neck in place of
a collar. Except for his mother, women played a very
small part in Mazzini’s life. One woman, who was
a widow called Giudetta Sidoli, kept up an affectionate
correspondence with him for a time, but there
was never any question of their marrying. His work,
his poverty, and his restless wandering made it impossible
for him to settle down as a married man.</p>

<p>After forming a “Young Europe” association of
men who believed in liberty, equality, and fraternity
for all mankind, and after issuing a newspaper called
<i>Young Switzerland</i> he was forced by the authorities
to leave Switzerland, and he took refuge in England.
As a lover of the beauties of nature, he complained at
first at having to go to what he called “the sunless
and musicless island.” “We have lost,” he wrote from
London, “even the sky which the veriest wretch on
the Continent can look at.” In time, however, he
came to regard with great affection the country which
has been a home and refuge to many disconsolate wanderers
and outcasts from foreign lands.</p>

<p>Mazzini came to England in 1837, and was obliged
to live at first in great poverty. But he had not come
to rest. It was always a hard struggle for him. After
a heated correspondence with his father, he ceased
to receive any money from home, and he got into
such low water that he actually had to pawn his rings,<span class="pagenum">208</span>
his watch, his books, and even on one occasion his
boots and waistcoat, in order to get money for food.
His generosity to others who were still worse off than
himself made things more difficult. In the winter he
risked his health by giving away his only overcoat.
At last he had to go to moneylenders. It was indeed
a desolate and miserable period for him, and had it
not been for the great spirit within him, he might
have broken down completely in despair. But he battled
on, learned the English language, wrote articles
for English newspapers, and began to make English
friends. His sympathies were always on the side of
the destitute and the downtrodden; he taught in an
evening school for poor Italian children, and worked
to prevent small boys of poverty-stricken parents in
Southern Italy being brought to England by scoundrels
who made them grind organs.</p>

<p>His first close English friendship was with the
great writer, Thomas Carlyle, and his wife. “They
love me as a brother,” he wrote, “and would like to do
me more good than it is in their power to do.” He
liked Carlyle’s open nature and broad views, but they
often had heated arguments. “He may preach the
merit of holding one’s tongue,” said the Italian, “but
the merit of silence is not his.” Mrs. Carlyle was at
first very sympathetic and interested in his political
views, but after a while she, like her husband, expressed
disapproval of his revolutionary ideas. However,
he continued to be a frequent caller, coming in<span class="pagenum">209</span>
all weathers, “his doeskin boots oozing out water
upon the carpets in a manner frightful to behold.”</p>

<p>Two or three years later, the breach between the
two men widened, and they saw no more of one another.
But Carlyle retained his respect for the
strange Italian exile, who he declared was the most
pious man he had ever met.</p>

<p>In many other English families Mazzini was received
with warm cordiality. He wrote a great deal
and completed the greater part of the finest of all
his works, “The Duties of Man.” But Italy was always
in his thoughts; he kept in constant communication
with the Italian leaders, for he dreaded dying
with his work undone. It was during this period that
the British Home Secretary, Sir John Graham, ordered
Mazzini’s letters to be opened as they passed
through the British Post Office, and communicated
their contents to the Neapolitan Government. A great
stir was caused by this. There were debates in Parliament,
a Committee of Inquiry was appointed, and
Mazzini’s character was successfully vindicated. This
episode, which was very discreditable to the British
Government, brought him many new friends.</p>

<p>In 1848 the good news came of the rising in North
Italy and the expulsion of the Austrians from Venice
and Lombardy. A flood of patriotism spread over
Italy, and volunteers poured to the front from all
parts. Mazzini immediately hurried to Milan, where
he was received in triumph as the prophet who had<span class="pagenum">210</span>
been cast out, but who had preached and suffered
while others fell away and doubted. Fighting continued,
but the King, Charles Albert, was a timid
man, quite incapable of dealing in a masterful way
with the situation that had arisen. He was willing
to consult Mazzini, but the enthusiastic reformer
would have no dealings with him. He refused for a
moment to set aside his hatred of monarchy, which
he described as “a hereditary lie.” This was not
the only instance in which his zeal for the republican
form of government prevented him from co-operating
with others who were just as eager as he was for a
united Italy.</p>

<p>The war continued. The Austrians gained victories
and Milan was occupied. Mazzini shouldered a rifle
and served in a small force under Garibaldi. Meanwhile,
in Central Italy, the Pope had fled and Rome
was declared a republic. Three men were appointed
to take over the government with supreme powers.
Of this triumvirate Mazzini was a member. The opportunity
had come for him to display his powers
as a ruler, and to put into practical form the theories
about which he had written and preached so much;
but it proved to be short. Nevertheless, he managed
to deal with a difficult situation with the utmost skill,
showing wisdom and moderation, erring, if anything,
on the side of leniency toward his enemies. He
adopted none of the pomp and ceremony of a ruler,
but lived with austere simplicity, unguarded, and ac<span class="pagenum">211</span>cessible
to all who wished to approach him. By this
mild authority he maintained order in the city, and
he might have succeeded in setting up good government
in a permanent form, had it not been for the
intervention of France. The attack on the Romans
by Louis Napoleon has been described as one of the
meanest political crimes, and indeed there was no
excuse for it. The siege lasted nearly a month, and
the city fell. The victors entered Rome. Garibaldi
with three thousand followers refused to surrender
and retreated. Mazzini fled the country. So ended
his brief experience as a ruler.</p>

<p>He could not remain in Switzerland; he therefore
returned to London. The death of his mother in 1852
came as a great blow to him. He had seen her in
Milan and had always kept in close correspondence
with her. “I have now no mother on earth except
my country,” he wrote, “and I shall be true to her
as my mother has been true to me.” She left him a
small annuity, so that although he was poor, he was
not in the desperate state of want he had been in
formerly. He had to live very simply, however, his
cigars being his only luxury. His most constant companions
were his tame linnets and canaries, which
perched about on his head and shoulders and hopped
about among his papers in the thick, smoky atmosphere
of his one room. He was very much appreciated
and respected by many prominent men of the time,
<span class="pagenum">212</span>
and his endeavor to enlist English sympathy for his
political schemes was not unsuccessful.</p>

<p>It was perhaps a pity that Mazzini did not devote
the remainder of his days to literary work, for as a
writer he would certainly have made a great mark.
His work as an agitator ceased to be useful or even
helpful. The course of events showed that if Italian
Unity was to be won it must be under the leadership
of Victor Emmanuel, who had succeeded Charles
Albert as King of Piedmont and Sardinia, and was
prepared to come forward as the leader of the movement.
Gallant little Piedmont continued to be the
leading spirit of the States of Italy. Cavour, the
statesman, a man of very different stamp from Mazzini,
worked slowly and patiently in the one direction
in which he saw success was possible. He despised
Mazzini and his doctrines, and probably regarded
him as a nuisance. The practical, capable,
hard-headed man of affairs found no use for the enthusiast
and the agitator, and did not even recognize
the great services which the idealist had rendered
in preparing and educating the mind of the people.
Mazzini, on the other hand, suspected Cavour and
mistrusted him, and doggedly refused to abandon his
hope of a republican form of government. He thought
a united Italy would succeed best if monarchy were
abolished; and in this belief perhaps he may only have
been rather in advance of his times. All the time he
<span class="pagenum">213</span>
overestimated the strength of his own following and
ignored the true state of affairs. This was partly due
to his enforced exile, which kept him out of contact
with the movements in Italy. With Garibaldi, the
great man of action, his relations were also strained.
They never saw eye to eye, and constantly differed
as to the best course to take. Garibaldi believed in
the King. Mazzini could never get over his engrained
prejudice against monarchy. Garibaldi was irritated
with Mazzini and called him “the great doctrinaire.”
But although they so often found it impossible to
act together, they became reconciled in the end, and
each recognized the other’s great talents and services.</p>

<p>Mazzini was accused of encouraging political assassination.
Many charges were brought against him
which were absolutely false, and he was wrongly suspected
of being at the back of various plots which
were discovered for the assassination of Victor Emmanuel
and Louis Napoleon. He had indeed said that
exceptional moments might arise when the killing of
a tyrant might be the only means of putting an end
to the intolerable oppression. In his early days, too,
a young man came to him with a plan for the assassination
of the King, Charles Albert. Mazzini, having
failed to dissuade him, helped him on his journey and
sent him a dagger. But in late life he not only vigorously
discouraged plots of this sort, but actually
stopped them. It is true, however, that his attempts
to justify violence on certain occasions, and the argu<span class="pagenum">214</span>ments
he used, came sadly below the noble ideas he
held as to the sacredness of human life.</p>

<p>Napoleon III he hated as much as he did the Austrians.
For a moment he was hopeful, after the
French victory of Solferino in 1859, and thought the
Austrian domination of Italy was at an end. But
when the peace of Villafranca came, by which Venetia
was abandoned to the enemy, and Cavour resigned,
he voiced the feeling of his country when he denounced
the betrayal and treachery of the French Emperor.
He hurried out to Florence, but the people dreaded
any repetition of his unsuccessful risings, and he
found he was powerless. Cavour became chief minister
again, and Garibaldi began to lay his plans for
the action which was to be eventually the determining
factor in the liberation of Italy. Mazzini welcomed
Garibaldi’s leadership, and was ready to keep himself
in the background. But his suspicion of Cavour,
his want of proper information, and his occasional
untimely interference made him useless at this period
of the struggle. He kept on dividing opinion at a
time when united action was the one obvious means
of achieving success. “Even against your wish you
divide us,” said one of Garibaldi’s followers to him
at Naples, where he was trying to make the people insist
on an Italian National Assembly drawing up a
new Constitution under the King. At last, worn out
in mind and body, he left Naples after having a
friendly interview with Garibaldi. It was not his<span class="pagenum">215</span>
jealousy of successful rivals that made Mazzini so
difficult to work with in these critical times. It was
his fear that others could not carry out the great object
in view unless they worked on his lines and shared
his distrust of the rule of kings and the intrigues of
statesmen. He refused to see that the royalists were
as seriously bent on unity as he was himself. He
became a broken and disappointed man, believing he
had failed, and despondent as to the future.</p>

<p>Unity was not yet complete: Rome and Venetia
were still to be won. On his return to England in
1860, Mazzini was content to suspend any open republican
agitation, but he kept up a good deal of
secret correspondence. His health began to break
down, but his will-power was still very strong. “It
is absurd to be ill,” he said, “while nations are struggling
for liberty.” Victor Emmanuel had some private
communications with him, for, curiously enough,
the two men had a certain fascination for each other.
The King shared the great agitator’s hatred of Austria
and his impatient desire to see the nationalities
of Eastern Europe set free. But nothing came of this.
Victor Emmanuel, who was now the figurehead of the
whole movement, was a rough, good-natured, rather
stupid man, who by his qualities as a soldier won the
loyalty and devotion of his people. He was essentially
a man of action, and military fame attracted him more
than anything else. When Garibaldi visited England
he had an enthusiastic reception from the public.<span class="pagenum">216</span>
Mazzini conferred with him, collected money for him,
and went as far as Lugano with the intention of
supporting him when the volunteers crossed from Sicily
for the march on Rome. But he went no further.</p>

<p>There was fighting again in 1866. The Italians
were defeated, and Napoleon III concluded a peace
by which the Austrians ceded Venetia to him, and he
handed it over to Italy. This was rather a humiliating
conclusion of this part of the struggle, and Mazzini
resented it. In spite of the failure of so many
of his efforts, he appeared to many of his fellow-countrymen
as a distant and rather wonderful figure,
surrounded by an atmosphere of mystery, with the one
thought of his beloved country ever in his mind. Their
confidence and respect for him were shown by the
fact that forty thousand people signed the petition
for his amnesty—that is to say, his return to Italy;
but when at last it was granted he refused to take
his seat as a deputy in Parliament, for although he
had been duly elected by Messina he would not take
the oath of allegiance to the monarchy.</p>

<p>The republic now came to be a more important object
to him than unity. He plotted and schemed, and
went so far as to intrigue with Bismarck in order
to get the help of Germany in what would have been
a civil war. He admired Bismarck’s tremendous determination,
and he believed in German unity, but he
added, “I abhor the Empire and the supremacy it
arrogates over Europe.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">217</span></p>

<p>Here is a description of the Italian political idealist
by one of the secret committee of Genoa, where each
man came to the meeting armed with a revolver: “A
low knock was heard at the door, and there he was
in body and soul, the great Magician, who struck the
fancy of the people like a mythical hero. Our hearts
leaped, and we went reverently to meet that great
soul. He advanced with a child’s frank courtesy and
a divine smile, shaking hands like an Englishman and
addressing each one of us by name, as if our names
were written on our foreheads. He was not disguised;
he wore cloth shoes and a capote, and with his
middle, upright stature he looked like a philosopher
straight from his study, who never dreamed of troubling
any police in the world.”</p>

<p>All his plots broke down, and again he was imprisoned
at Palermo. Here he read a great deal, smoked
incessantly bad cigars, and laid the schemes of fresh
books. When Rome was captured he was released.
Italian unity was accomplished, but because Italy
was not republican, Mazzini felt his dream was
spoilt.</p>

<p>For the remainder of his days he lived at Pisa.
Daily, people saw the white-haired stranger taking his
walks and stopping frequently to talk to children:
and here he died in March, 1872. He was buried by
his mother’s side in Genoa. By a unanimous vote the
Italian Parliament expressed the national sorrow, and
the president pronounced a eulogy on the departed<span class="pagenum">218</span>
patriot, who had devoted his life to his country’s
freedom.</p>

<p>Mazzini was one of those curious independent men,
of passionate sincerity and tremendous energy, who
make things very uncomfortable, and who will always
be detested by those easygoing people who prefer to
accept things as they are so long as their own ease
and comfort are not disturbed. His astonishing talents
and qualities were balanced by great faults, but
they were more faults of judgment than of character.
He was very far from perfect. But the perfect
man has yet to appear, and if he does appear he will
probably be quite intolerable, because there is always
something in people’s faults which endears them to
us. Mazzini was a lonely figure, courageous, humble,
and without personal ambition. But he could not
work successfully with others, for he would never
compromise. He seems to have had peculiar difficulty
in translating his thoughts and ideas into action. In
fact, running through his whole career, there is a
strange contradiction between his lofty ideals, his
deep religious beliefs, his noble ambitions, on the one
hand, and his petty intrigues, his futile plots, and his
false estimate of men, on the other hand. Judged by
his writings, he would appear to be a great hero whose
moral purpose was an inspiration to the whole world,
but whose talents had never been fully developed, because
they were neglected for other forms of activity.
Judged by his actions, he appears a determined but<span class="pagenum">219</span>
perpetually misguided agitator, obstinate, impulsive,
and adopting the methods of a conspirator.</p>

<p>He knew the religious spirit must be the foundation
of any great moral movement. But his religion
was broad and simple: he thought the orthodox Christian
doctrine had much in it which prevented it having
the power and influence it ought. He had a firm
belief in democracy—that is to say, in the rule of
the people as opposed to the absolute rule of kings
and ministers. But he saw that advance in this direction
could only be brought about through education,
and that was why he devoted so much of his
time to educating poor people and writing books for
them.</p>

<p>The whole idea of nationality was, in Mazzini’s
opinion, based on the will of the people. It must be
remembered that in his day Europe was divided up,
to a large extent, into territories formed by the interests
and ambitions of royal dynasties, or in the name
of the absurd principle known as “the balance of
power,” which means the grouping of two sets of
nations in opposition to one another—a policy which
has been the cause of many wars. Nationality, Mazzini
maintained, was not just a question of people
of the same race, or people who spoke the same language,
or even people who lived in the same country,
having the right to make themselves into a separate
nation. In the case of Italy, as in the case of Great
Britain, the geographical area is so well defined by<span class="pagenum">220</span>
Nature, with its seas and mountains, that the problem
presented is quite easy. But there are other territories
where neither geographical formation, nor language,
nor race, shows very accurately what the frontiers
of the nation should be. History and tradition
may form some guide, but the needs and wishes of the
people concerned should always be taken into account.
“Nationalities,” said Mazzini, “can be founded only
for, and upon, and by the people.”</p>

<p>It was the fundamental truth which he always
sought for. He was a patriot in the best sense of
the word. But he hated sentimental bragging and
showy patriotism. A man must not borrow luster
from his country, but give luster to it by service and
devotion. Patriotism to him was an intense regard
for his country’s moral greatness. “The honor of a
country,” he declared, “depends much more on removing
its faults than on boasting of its qualities.”</p>

<p>His service to his country is difficult to measure.
Although his practical part in the actual accomplishment
of Italian unity cannot be compared with that
of Cavour and Garibaldi, it was his bold vision which
first saw that the object was attained: it was he that
gave others the faith to pursue it: without him the
great achievement might have been long delayed. It
was Mazzini who supplied the fuel for the furnace,
the impulse for the blow, and the unselfish motive
which alone could stir his fellow-countrymen to noble
deeds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">221</span></p>

<p>The services of such a man are seldom recognized at
the time. But when the fight is over and the general
survey is made of all the stages which led ultimately
to success, people come to understand the great value
and the enormous influence of the noble ideas which
first set the movement going.</p>

WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON<br /><br />

1805–1879</h2>



<p class="center"><small>My country is the world; my countrymen are all mankind.</small><br /><br /></p>


<p><span class="smcap">William Lloyd Garrison</span> was the man who more
than any one else helped to abolish slavery. He was
what we call a Pioneer—or one who leads the way—because,
though some people had hoped for the gradual
freedom of the negroes, and a few had worked for it,
Garrison was the first to ask for their immediate freedom
and to set to work to make this question the most
living and important one of the day. For he believed
that if a thing is wrong in itself it should not exist
another hour. Garrison was born at Newburyport,
Mass., December 10, 1805. Like Thoreau and Hans
Andersen, he was of humble birth and had a very
hard childhood. His mother had been deserted by
his father, and he was obliged to earn money to help
her keep the home together. So as quite a small boy
he went about peddling apples, and later worked at
shoemaking and cabinet-making and other trades; he
hated them all, and on one occasion ran away to sea.<span class="pagenum">224</span>
There was no time for learning from books, and he
had practically no schooling. But when he was thirteen
he became apprenticed to the printers’ business
in the office of the Newburyport <i>Herald</i>, and to this
work he took like a duck to water. He showed peculiar
skill at printing, and also a great gift for writing.
He wrote and sent articles to different papers
and he read a great deal. He liked romantic books,
the novels of Sir Walter Scott and the poems of
Byron particularly. He wrote poetry himself which
is considered good. His mother had always warned
her son against being an author, as she believed the
lot of all literary men was to die of starvation in a
garret. Nevertheless, Garrison seemed cut out for
an editor or writer. He was left alone in the world
when he was eighteen, for his mother died and his
only brother, a bad lot, had disappeared. His apprenticeship
with the printer ended when he was twenty-one.
At this time he was a very taking and charming
young man, with a refined, sensitive, clean-shaven
face, and always well dressed; pleasant, mildly ambitious,
and social, enjoying parties and going to church
regularly, he conformed outwardly to what the world
thinks is the right and proper thing. But there was
more in William Lloyd Garrison than met the eye.
His friends, who had complete trust in him, now lent
him money to start a newspaper of his own. He called
it the Newburyport <i>Free Press</i>, and became the editor
and proprietor of it, and wrote, too, most of the arti<span class="pagenum">225</span>cles.
But the views in them were much too independent
to please the ordinary person, and it failed.</p>

<p>Garrison had always had a strong tendency to question
authority—he was not going to take anybody’s
word for a thing without thinking it all out for himself—as
a boy he had taken up the cause of liberty
wherever it had arisen and had been greatly moved
by the struggles of the Greeks to throw off Turkish
tyranny. But now again he was a printer in search
of work, and after hard times he became the editor
of a temperance paper, <i>The National Philanthropist</i>,
in Boston, and then again the proprietor of a newspaper
called <i>The Journal of the Times</i>. Once more he
showed himself to be very much ahead of people in
moral matters. In a number of this paper he wrote
a forcible article on a law which had been passed in
one of the States of America against teaching the
blacks to read and write. He said how pitiable it
was to seal up the mind and intellect of man to brutal
incapacity.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a id="p224" name="p224">
<img src="images/i_fp224.jpg" width="500" height="608" alt="WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON" /></a>
<div class="caption">WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON</div>
</div>

<p>“This state of things,” he declared with vehemence,
“must come to an end.” The article drew the attention
to him of a much older man—Benjamin Lundy—an
excellent Quaker who had for some years past been
agitating against slavery, and he now got into touch
with Garrison. Garrison was deeply moved by
Lundy’s preaching, and equally disgusted with the
attitude of the clergy, to whom Lundy appealed in
vain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">226</span></p>

<p>It was almost impossible to get a church or a school
for an anti-slavery meeting, and when they did succeed,
on one occasion, the meeting was broken up by
a clergyman who denounced the agitation against
slavery as dangerous. “The moral cowardice, the
chilling apathy, the criminal unbelief and cruel skepticism
that were revealed,” says Garrison on that occasion,
“filled me with rage,” and from that time he
ceased to go to church.</p>

<p>Garrison was asked now by Lundy to become editor
with him of a paper called <i>The Genius of Universal
Emancipation</i>, whose object was to suppress drink and
to free the negro. Garrison joined him. He wrote
most of the articles and Lundy did the lecturing. The
articles were very clear and forcible. “For ourselves,”
the paper declared, “we are resolved to agitate
this subject to the utmost; nothing but death
shall prevent us from denouncing a crime which has
no parallel in human depravity.” Garrison worked
hard: he got subscribers to the paper and managed
to start a petition against slavery, which was signed
by over two thousand people, and was presented
to Congress. The answer came back that agitation
would make the slaves restless and difficult to
manage, and would put ideas into their heads when
they might be comparatively happy and contented.</p>

<p>You can imagine the scorn Garrison felt for his
Government. What else could he feel about a Government
which boasted of itself as a democratic Gov<span class="pagenum">227</span>ernment,
which desired all people to have equal opportunities,
rich or poor, and which, while sitting in the
Capitol could see every day the manacled slave driven
past the door to market? Custom, as it so often does,
had blunted the sensibilities of these Senators: they
remained untouched and unmoved. It needed a young,
fresh, open mind like that of Garrison to show them
the way. He was only twenty-six, but he saw clearly
what much older men did not see, that in the long
run the moral point of view is the only point of view,
that right or justice is the only thing to work for,
and all other issues are of no account at all. But
it does not, perhaps, seem to us now a very wonderful
thing that Garrison should have been so shocked and
horrified at what he saw and heard about slavery.
What strikes us as incredible now is that there were
many thousands of people, and quite humane, kind
people too, who defended it. It was the custom of
the country and part of the Constitution. Many people
didn’t trouble to reason about it; indeed, they believed
that were slavery abolished the country would
be ruined—they would have no cotton, no corn, no
tobacco, because there would be no laborers to till
the soil or to harvest the crops. The black men and
women did the work for nothing. But so short-sighted
and stupid were commercial people generally,
that they could not see that slavery, besides being
a moral wrong, was also a mistake economically. In
the long run it was more expensive, because the work<span class="pagenum">228</span>
was less well done; an intelligent person who takes
some interest in his work will do it very much better
than one hardly removed from the animals.</p>

<p>One Sunday in Baltimore, Garrison was visited by
a slave who had just been whipped with a cowhide,
and whose back was bleeding from twenty-seven
gashes, while his head was terribly bruised. He had
not loaded a wagon to his master’s liking, and this
was his punishment. Garrison could hear as he passed
down the street the sound of whips and cries of agony.
There seemed no mercy or justice anywhere, and his
country’s barbarity made Garrison’s cheeks burn with
shame.</p>

<p>How did such a state of things arise, one may ask;
how did these black men and women come to be living
in such numbers on American soil? It happened in
this way: the English in the past, having conquered
lands in different parts of the world, needed men to
work and develop these lands. They were mostly wild
and uncultivated. The British, the Spaniards, and
the Portuguese were chiefly responsible for the slave
trade. Prince Henry the Navigator, a Portuguese,
had been the first to bring negroes into Europe in
the fifteenth century, capturing them on his exploring
expeditions round the coast of Africa. Sir John
Hawkins was the first Englishman to engage in the
traffic, and in the seventeenth century the slave trade
was mostly in English hands. England made a very
good business of supplying slaves to the Spanish set<span class="pagenum">229</span>tlements,
and imported also a huge cargo of negroes
to Virginia for tobacco planting, and this was the
beginning of slavery in America.</p>

<p>This hunting of human beings to make them slaves
was more barbarous than anything the negroes themselves
could have imagined. These wretched black
men, having been captured, their huts destroyed and
whole villages burnt, were placed on ships which
brought them to our colonies, to the West Indies and
Jamaica; so packed and overloaded were these ships
and the poor negroes were so ill-treated that many
died on the way; out of a hundred only fifty would
be any good for work. This was one of the prices
paid for what is called expansion and having colonies.
When the English came to know the real nature of
this dreadful business, all the best opinion was against
it; but the Quakers were the first to take any practical
action against the slave trade, which they did as
early as the seventeenth century, both in America and
England, by turning out of their society all who should
be engaged in it. Gradually the British did away
with slavery in their colonies, and it was finally abolished
in 1833, when Lord Grey was Prime Minister;
but the honor of being the first to abolish it lies not
with England but with Denmark, who forbade it in
its possessions at the end of the eighteenth century.
Several countries followed the example of England
after she had put down slavery so far as it concerned
herself, but the United States was the last to fall in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">230</span></p>

<p>Garrison in his campaign against slavery was not
going to tolerate any half-measures; if a thing was a
sin, then it should not exist another day: it was real
anguish to have to think of the sufferings of these
poor people, and he could not rest or be happy for a
moment so long as injustice and such a barbarous
state of things existed. Therefore, the immediate freedom
of the negro was the only thing to strive and live
for. Here he and Lundy disagreed—not as to the
evil of slavery, but on the question of the best way
to put an end to it. Lundy was not so extreme as
Garrison. His view was that the negro should gradually
be set free and sent to colonize in another country.
Garrison asked for his immediate freedom on
American soil. His attitude made the slave-owners
very angry, and also filled them with alarm: they had
heard a good deal of talk about freeing the negro in
the future, but never had the demand been made for
his immediate release. So Garrison now broke his
partnership with Lundy and started on his campaign
alone. For a so-called libel on a slave trader he was
sent to prison, and being unable to pay the fine, he
was forty-nine days in jail, until he was released by
Arthur Tappan, of New York, a famous Quaker
philanthropist and abolitionist, who paid his fine for
him. Garrison was no martyr, but his anger was
aroused against the slave-owners and he felt more
desperately keen about his cause than ever. Once
more he looked to the churches to support him, and<span class="pagenum">231</span>
again they failed him. In Boston they closed their
doors against him, and it was a society of free-thinkers
who finally gave Garrison a hall to lecture in, and
some who heard him there were moved to join him
and assist in his campaign.</p>

<p>Never did a man have more uphill work in trying
to move these people out of their sloth and indifference.
He visited all the principal people in Boston
and urged them to think; he implored the clergy to
turn to Christianity and bring it into practice. Coldheartedness
and utter contempt of the negro he met
with everywhere. He was disheartened but undefeated;
his hatred of injustice, his loathing of cruelty,
his pity, all these feelings carried him on.</p>

<p>In order to further his views he set up a paper of
his own in Boston. He had no money nor a single
subscriber, but he found a sympathetic partner, and
these two printed their own paper, their only helper
being a negro boy. It was called <i>The Liberator</i>, and
its motto was “My country is the world; my countrymen
are all mankind.” By this he meant that
he worked for the good of the whole world, not only
for that portion of it to which he himself belonged,
for only by treating men of other countries as your
friends and brothers will you have progress, peace,
and true prosperity at home.</p>

<p>In the first number of <i>The Liberator</i>, Garrison had
a manifesto, or address, to the public, the words of
which became the whole spirit of his life. He de<span class="pagenum">232</span>clared
that he would work for and think of nothing
else but the freedom of the slave, and ended up with
the words, “I am in earnest: I will not equivocate,
I will not excuse, I will not retreat a single inch, and
I will be heard.” This address was signed by twelve
men, all poor, but after they had met together one
evening for the purpose of signing the address they
stepped out into the starry night with glad hearts
and an object to live for. This address of Garrison’s
lost him many subscribers, because it went too
far and was thought too extreme, but gradually it
gained him influence and power. It was the seed of
many anti-slavery societies, and it started other newspapers
working with the same objects. <i>The Liberator</i>
was destined to contain President Lincoln’s declaration
of emancipation.</p>

<p>An anti-slavery society had been started in England,
supported by the great and courageous clergyman
Wilberforce, who had been for years working
against slavery and had helped to bring it to an end
in the British possessions. Garrison was asked to
go over and speak to the English society, which
he did, and was received with great enthusiasm. The
English were very much impressed by Garrison’s sincerity
and the burning enthusiasm that lay under his
quiet and modest manner. He was not the sort of
man they imagined an American agitator to be. He
was, of course, very greatly encouraged, but on his
return to America hard times awaited him, because<span class="pagenum">233</span>
he had stated in England that the United States was
a sham so long as it allowed the present state of
things to exist. A meeting in New York to start
an anti-slavery league was broken up and the hall
emptied by a furious mob. Another mob also besieged
and tried to destroy the offices of <i>The Liberator</i>
at Boston. There was great excitement everywhere:
Garrison’s work had begun to tell. Disagreeable
though violent opposition is, it is often the first
step toward being heard. Now, Garrison undoubtedly
criticized his country; he found fault with it,
and used very strong language about the slave-owners.
The commonly held view is that any criticism of one’s
country is treacherous, mischievous, and unpatriotic,
but Garrison said:</p>


<p class="small">I speak the truth, painful, humiliating, and terrible as
it is, and because I am bold and faithful to do so, am
I to be branded as the calumniator and enemy of my
country? If to suffer sin upon my brother be to hate
him in my heart, then to suffer sin upon my country would
be an evidence not of my love but hatred of her; it is
because my affection for her is intense and paramount
to all selfish considerations that I do not parley with her
crime. I know that she can neither be truly happy nor
prosperous while she continues to manacle every sixth
child born on her soil.</p>

<p>Who, then, one may ask, is the true patriot? He
who has before his eyes a high ideal for his country,
who wishes it to be the best, the most civilized and
<span class="pagenum">234</span>
the most prosperous, its people educated, far-seeing,
and humane; who does not shut his eyes to his country’s
faults and to the mistakes of its governments,
but who strives to help as he would help a friend to
remedy his faults—to show people how things might
be better and how to set about improving them? Or
is the patriot the man who in the face of monstrous
evils cries “It is God’s will,” or “My country, right
or wrong”? Where should we be now were it not for
the men who obeyed their own consciences rather
than the commands of the State? When we think
that burning people at the stake for their religious
beliefs, hanging them for sheep-stealing, putting
women to death for petty thefts, or working small
children in mines were considered right, when we
remember that these inhuman laws were regarded by
the patriot of the time as the will of God, and the
people who wished to see them altered as disloyal to
their rulers, we may be a little less bitter against the
reformer of the present day: the man who sees that
there are still many unjust laws and conditions even
in his own country, and who has the courage to say so.</p>

<p>Garrison, however, found now enough support to
start what was known as “The American Anti-slavery
Society.” He called together a meeting for the purpose
at Philadelphia, when he made a striking declaration
of his beliefs. He spoke the most moving and
inspiring words about the state of the slaves and the
rights of liberty. He announced what their work
<span class="pagenum">235</span>
would be: to organize anti-slavery societies everywhere,
to hold meetings unceasingly, to circulate literature,
to spare no efforts whatever to bring the nation,
as he expressed it, “to a speedy repentance.”</p>

<p>Now began what has been called “the martyr age”
in America, and the most active period of Garrison’s
life. He and his followers held meetings night and
day, and mobs of rough and brutal men were sent
by their opponents to break them up. Anti-slavery
people were in danger of their lives; they were mobbed
wherever they were known, and their houses burnt or
ruined. Halls where meetings were to be held were
destroyed. A young divinity student was flogged publicly
for having anti-slavery literature in his bag. Another
lost his life defending a friend against the ruffians
who attacked him. In the South, men even suspected
of favoring the abolition of slaves were lynched,
and judges were all in favor of slavery, and treated
the anti-slavery people as vagabonds. Garrison on one
occasion had his clothes torn off him and was dragged
through the streets with a rope round his body. He
was rescued from a raging crowd by the mayor of the
town, who saw no way of protecting him but by putting
him in prison. On the wall of his cell Garrison
wrote: “William L. Garrison was put into this cell
on Wednesday afternoon, October 21, 1835, to save
him from the violence of a respectable and influential
mob who sought to destroy him for preaching the
abominable and dangerous doctrine that all men are<span class="pagenum">236</span>
created equal and that all oppression is odious in the
sight of God.” A merchant on one occasion spoke
in public to the abolitionists. “It is not a matter of
principle with us,” he said; “it is a business necessity;
we cannot afford to let you succeed; we do not
mean to allow you to succeed; we mean to put you
down by fair means if we can, by foul means if we
must.” Garrison said that Government and the heads
of commerce were the forces that really kept slavery
going; it could not, he felt, be the will of the people
when they began to think and to understand what
the real nature of slavery was. It was the business
of his life to show them, and he devoted all his energies,
all his power of eloquence and persuasion, to
move the people, to appeal to their reason and sense
of justice and compassion. He sought to abolish slavery
by moral means alone; he did not attempt political
means, such as asking Congress to use its power.
He worked only in the Northern States, for the South
was practically united in its convictions. He found
strong opposition in the North, too, for there were
many Northern people who looked upon the Constitution
as sacred, and because the principle of slavery
was incorporated in it, regarded all opposition to slavery
as disloyalty to the State.</p>

<p>Garrison was undoubtedly helped by the Fugitive
Slave Law. It is often the case that things get worse
before they get better. This cruel law was a case in
point. It was this: that those slaves who had escaped<span class="pagenum">237</span>
from the Southern States and were living in Canada
or the North, some of them well off, useful, and happy,
were to be hunted down and brought back to slavery;
those who housed them and helped them in any way
to escape would also be fined or imprisoned. The result
of this new law was to rouse the people’s feeling
for liberty and to touch their hearts. When they saw
the wretched fugitives driven along the streets in
chains great feeling was shown. “Uncle Tom’s
Cabin” was inspired by incidents resulting from the
Fugitive Slave Law. Though written in an old-fashioned
way, with a good deal of religious talk,
it is a moving and sincere book, by a writer whose
heart was full of pity and indignation. It touched
many hearts, including those of the clergy, and stirred
people to action. It had perhaps more influence than
any book with a purpose that has ever been written.</p>

<p>The people of the North suffered great humiliation
at this period, for nothing could save them from lending
their troops and using all their forces to help in
slave catching, for it was the law of their Constitution.
John Brown also, in connection with this law,
appeared rather violently upon the scene. Most people
have heard of him; many have heard of him who
do not know anything about W. L. Garrison. He became
a hero and a martyr by being hanged as a rebel,
and the song written about him, “John Brown’s body
lies a-moldering in the grave, but his soul goes marching
on,” became a sort of “Marseillaise” of the North,<span class="pagenum">238</span>
and has undoubtedly helped to keep his memory alive.
John Brown had been for some time a keen anti-slavery
agitator, and when the Fugitive Slave Law
was passed he carried out a scheme of his own for
helping to hide and establish fugitives in a stronghold
he had built in the mountains of Virginia. For
an armed raid which he made into that State with
slaves, in which he captured an arsenal, he was
brought up on the charge of high treason and hanged.</p>

<p>Garrison thought John Brown courageous and disinterested,
but he also thought the raid wild and useless;
but then Garrison’s views of war and bloodshed
were very different from John Brown’s. One thing
he did see was the wonderful change that thirty years
of fighting against slavery had brought about in the
tremendous outburst of sympathy for Brown, for great
indignation was shown and felt at his fate.</p>

<p>Up to this time it would have been almost impossible
for a President to be chosen who was not loyal to
slavery. But times had changed, and Garrison, if
he had not been entirely responsible, had been the
principal cause of the change in people’s views; the
sympathies of Lincoln, who was a candidate for the
Presidency of the United States, were known—he was
against slavery, and he was elected by the North, for
the hearts of the people had been moved.</p>

<p>Garrison for the first time saw the results of his
life’s work, and it is more than some reformers have
done. In the election of Lincoln as President he could<span class="pagenum">239</span>
see, though still a long way off, an end to his labors,
to the long and weary battle he had fought. But
much suffering and anguish was to be gone through
before anything could be accomplished. Lincoln was
elected by the Northern States, and the South, furious,
declared themselves independent of the Government
and the Union, and forming a Government of their
own, called themselves “The Confederate States of
America.” Civil war started, and never was a war
more passionately felt on both sides. It was not a
war of Governments, or a war merely to decide
whether the South should be united to the North, but
it involved a living question of right or wrong between
those who believed in slavery and those who did not.
The people knew what they were fighting about, which
is more often the case in civil war than in wars between
nations planned by their Governments. Garrison
had been a man of peace. He hated war and
preached against it, yet he saw that the conflict could
not be stopped. It had been taken out of his hands.
Slavery must be overthrown, and, hateful though it
was to him, blood, it seemed, must be spilt.</p>

<p>Every American knows the story of that struggle.
The war began in 1861 and lasted four years, ending
in a victory for the North, though the South fought
desperately and gained much sympathy by their bravery.
As the struggle went on the hatred of slavery
grew, and before it ended many slaves were set free.
Various States were asked to free their slaves, and<span class="pagenum">240</span>
those who did not were held to be in rebellion against
the State. The total abolition of slavery by an amendment
of the Constitution did not come about till the
close of the war in 1865.</p>

<p>Garrison tells of visiting a camp of twelve hundred
slaves just liberated. He called upon them to give
cheers for freedom, and to his astonishment they were
silent: the poor things did not know how to cheer.</p>

<p>It may be asked how Garrison set the slaves free,
for he had not the power to do so. He had done so
by preparing the ground, by educating the people,
rousing them from their selfishness and awakening in
them a moral sense. His efforts were rewarded by
the election of Lincoln, who as President had the
power to complete and to crown the work that Garrison
had done.</p>

<p>To the truly great man it is the triumph of his
cause, and not personal success, that will make him
glad and thankful. Garrison’s contemporaries fully
realized how he had been the chief cause in bringing
about the emancipation of the slaves. Those who have
lived since may have forgotten, and the great figure
of Lincoln stands out as the man who before all others
brought an infamous system to an end.</p>

<p>Garrison’s work was done, and he retired into private
life. He had not been spoilt by publicity; he
never really cared for a life of excitement; he was
extraordinarily modest and had no personal ambition
at all. Though most of his life he had been abused<span class="pagenum">241</span>
and slandered, it had never made him bitter; he remained
happy, serene, and good-tempered in himself,
and kept his warm affections to the end of his life.
His domestic life, too, was very happy, and he was
devoted to his wife and children. He died when he
was seventy-three, at Boston, quite peacefully, his
wife having died three years before him.</p>

<p>Garrison had his faults, if faults they could be
called. He was too easily taken in—he had perhaps
too open a mind, and at one time got into the hands
of some rather shady people, who led him to take up
spiritualism, quack medicines, phrenology, homeopathy,
and so on. He was always hoping that any
one of these things might possibly help to improve the
conditions of mankind. But some of his fads, as they
were then called, have become the beliefs of a great
many people in the world. The supporters of <i>The
Liberator</i> were annoyed with Garrison for preaching
in his paper against capital punishment, against governments
and the Church, and in favor of votes for
women and temperance. They did not see why they
should have to believe in these things because they
believed in the freeing of the negro. But Garrison’s
beliefs were the result of his experience and circumstances.
He hated governments because his Government
had built up its Constitution on slavery; he
despised the Church because it upheld the crime of
slavery; if it did not give it active support, it gave
it by silence as to its evils, by tolerating slave-holding<span class="pagenum">242</span>
by its ministers and members, and by preventing whenever
it could meetings or discussions being held
against it. The Church, Garrison thought, should not
be regarded as the Church of Christ, but as the foe
of freedom, humanity, and religion. He hated Sunday
because on that day no abolition meetings could
be held—yet, as we know, he had been a strict church-goer
as a young man, and was always to the end of
his life a Christian, longing for men and women and
the Church to turn to true Christianity, apart from
its forms and dogmas.</p>

<p>Garrison had demanded for the negro full citizenship,
but he did not live to see how strong is the
prejudice in many places against black people. He
had not to face this problem of race. It was a great
step in the history of civilization to abolish slavery,
but it was not the end of the negro question. Is the
black man to have the same rights as the white man,
the same opportunities for education and improvement?
Is there a place for him in this world? Can
he make himself useful and indispensable? If we
read the history of the negroes’ struggles to get education
against fearful difficulties and opposition, of
how they endeavored to learn with their clouded, unused
minds, and of how they succeeded in lifting
themselves by their own efforts out of ignorance and
degradation, I think we must believe that there is a
place for them, that, given a share in the world’s work
and its responsibilities, they will show themselves<span class="pagenum">243</span>
worthy of the trust put in them. But the white man
himself must become more enlightened before an answer
to this problem can be found. In the words of
a remarkable negro, Booker Washington, who rose
from being a slave to the position of a great teacher:
“You cannot hold a man down in a ditch without
stopping down there with him yourself.”</p>

HENRY THOREAU<br /><br />

1817–1862</h2>



<p><small>I never found the companion that was so companionable as
solitude.</small><br /><br /></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Henry David Thoreau</span> was born in Concord, Massachusetts,
July 12, 1817, and lived most of his life in
or near his native town. The world, if you were to
ask it who Thoreau was, would probably say “a
crank,” because he did not think and act in quite the
same way as other people, and because he practised
what he preached. He never went to church or voted
at elections, or drank wine or smoked tobacco, and
he went to live alone in the woods. He was an author
and a naturalist; and, happily for us, he has been
able to reveal through his writings what sort of man
he was.</p>

<p>But people trouble themselves nowadays very little
about the quiet, retiring souls, and so “Walden,”
the book Thoreau wrote on his Experiment—as he
called his period of retirement in the woods, is not
so well known as it ought to be; for it seems to stand
alone in its beauty and originality; no other book is<span class="pagenum">246</span>
like it. As we hurry and scurry through this mechanical
century, we might do well to turn to its quiet
pages, and if we do we may wonder if Thoreau was
not the wise one and we the cranks after all.</p>

<p>Henry Thoreau’s childhood was a calm and happy
one. He was brought up under the best possible conditions
for forming a steadfast and unworldly character.
Concord was a large, quiet village of plain
white houses and shady elm-trees—a specially good
example of a New England village community. There
were no very rich people and no very poor: the inhabitants
managed all their little affairs for themselves,
and were perfectly capable of so doing. They
were shrewd, honest, good people, and friendly towards
one another. They seemed to have few worldly
ambitions and were naturally inclined to be simple
and democratic. They had simple occupations and
amusements and did not crave for excitement, as we
do now. Concord produced a very fine race of people
and a few remarkable individuals—Emerson, Hawthorne,
and Thoreau himself; there were others less
well known, but equally stalwart in character. Emerson,
the poet and philosopher, no doubt helped his
neighbors to become more cultivated and ideal: he
brought them into touch with all the enlightened
thought of that day, for it was the period when Carlyle
and Wordsworth and Coleridge were living in
England, and when the civilized world was beginning
to wake up to many problems it had never
<span class="pagenum">247</span>thought about before, or had accepted as dispensations
of Providence.</p>

<div class="caption">H. D. THOREAU, 1861</div>
</div>

<p>In this safe and peaceful atmosphere of good-will
and honest endeavor the Thoreaus lived. They were
poor and had no worldly advantages; but they had
what was far better, the position which comes from
having qualities of independence and courage, and
they were respected and looked up to by their neighbors.
Henry Thoreau’s father made lead pencils for
a living, and Henry learnt to make them too—very
skilfully, it is said. He had two sisters and a brother,
but even as a child Henry Thoreau showed the most
marked character of the lot. He was always determined
to go his own way, and was quite sure of what
he liked and disliked. But he was also very like other
children, for when he was told that he would one day
go to heaven, he said he did not want to, because he
would not be allowed to take his sled with him. He
had heard that only very grand things were allowed
in heaven, and his sled was quite common and had
been made at home.</p>

<p>Thoreau went to college—to Harvard—like any
other young man, and did nothing very brilliant while
he was there; when he left, he took to teaching and to
writing, which was his great talent. He had always
written from quite early days, keeping a diary about
all the things he observed in nature—the tints of
morning and evening skies, the songs of birds, the
habits of animals, and the flowering and growth of<span class="pagenum">248</span>
plants and trees. He had extraordinary powers of
observation and was a very remarkable naturalist;
his understanding of animals was almost uncanny—they
seemed to realize how akin he was to them.
Hunted foxes would come to him for protection, and
wild squirrels would nestle in his coat; he could
thrust his hand into a pool and pull out a fish, which
seemed to trust him and show no objection! Thoreau
was absolutely at home in the open air; he could
skate and swim and row and sail. He thought that
every boy between the ages of ten and fourteen should
shoulder a gun, but that it should only be wild shooting,
limitless, and not enclosed like the shooting of
English noblemen. Fishermen and hunters, he observed,
seemed to get into peculiar touch with nature
in the intervals of their sport. But Thoreau himself
gave up shooting entirely as he grew older, and studied
the habits of birds with a spy-glass; he learnt to
remain absolutely motionless, as still as the wall or
ground he rested on. From earliest childhood he made
collections of Indian relics and of turtles and fishes.
He liked to take immense journeys in search of interesting
new plants and animals; once he went three
hundred and twenty-five miles in a canoe with an Indian.
He would camp out and be exposed to all
weathers; often he was cold and hungry. A friend
describes with a shiver how he slept out with Thoreau
on the bare rocks of a mountain without enough blankets;
but Thoreau, if he loved a thing, could not do it<span class="pagenum">249</span>
moderately, and, though he was so hardy, he ended
by hurting himself and destroying his health.</p>

<p>From living so much with nature and animals,
Thoreau got to look rather like a “wise wild beast”;
this was how his friends described him. His face was
ruddy and weather-beaten and very honest-looking;
his nose was large and somewhat like a beak; his
brows overhanging—but every one agreed that his
eyes were the most attractive part of his face. They
were sometimes blue and sometimes gray, and full
of kindness and thought. He hated fine clothes and
dressing up, so he always wore strong things, like
corduroy (which no gentleman at that period would
think of wearing), in order that he could make his
way through the wood and climb rocks without tearing
anything. His sisters and relations said he was
simply delightful at home. He was a sort of household
treasure, because he was always kind and useful
and obliging. He would grow melons and plant
the orchard, act as a mechanic—in fact, he was clever
at any odd job with his hands—and he would attend
to the animals and flowers. He was happy with children,
and invented all sorts of games to amuse them
and himself. He had no false pride, and was not
ashamed to be seen in an old coat whitewashing the
house or mending the gates. He was a great traveler
in a small circle, but he never until the year before
he died saw Niagara, or ever crossed the ocean. “I
have a real genius for staying at home,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">250</span></p>

<p>When he was twenty-five, Thoreau went to live with
Emerson and a circle of friends on a farm near his
own village of Concord. Emerson being older than
Thoreau, was regarded by him as his teacher. There
is no doubt that Emerson had a good deal of influence
over the younger man and they thought alike
about many things; but they were very different in
temperament. Emerson was perhaps the more human,
and he certainly had more personal charm, but
Thoreau was the more original of the two. Emerson
persuaded his young friend to join a sect of people
formed with the object of improving the outlook of
mankind; they wished to simplify living and to combine
leisure for study with manual labor. Every member
of the community had to do his or her share of
the work to keep the house and farm going. They
would plow, milk, make hay, cultivate the garden,
and the women would wash up the dishes in the intervals
of discussing how best to equalize the lots of rich
and poor, how to simplify education so that every one
might be educated, and how to destroy class differences.
They were more like anarchists than socialists,
because they did not believe in governments and
had nothing to do with politics. Hawthorne, one of
the members of this Brook Farm society, wrote a novel
about them which gives a very vivid picture of their
lives. They were not, except for a few members, particularly
brilliant people, and their society cannot be
called very successful if it is judged by renown, or<span class="pagenum">251</span>
by the amount of attention it got from fashionable
people. This may have been because it avoided eccentricities
and had very few rules—no sect could have
had less—and indeed they were particularly keen on
not interfering with a person’s liberty or private life.
Idealism and Economy were the two principal articles
of their faith. They were kind, simple, hopeful people,
and were known as the Transcendentalists.</p>

<p>Thoreau lived with them for three years. The digging
and outdoor work were easy congenial tasks to
him, but Emerson, on the contrary, found that digging
interfered with his writing, and after he left
the sect he never again attempted to combine the two.</p>

<p>Thoreau was twenty-eight when he decided to go
away and live by himself. It was not a sudden wish,
for he had been thinking of it for some years. It
was not because he was a hater of men that he wanted
to get away, but he wished to find the answer to certain
questions which had been bothering him. He
was anxious to find out what real life could teach
him, stripped of all its stupid complications and conventions.
He wished also to study and to satisfy
himself that he could be an author, and he went, too,
because he hoped to draw strength and purpose from
his experiment.</p>

<p>At this period he possessed only twenty-five dollars
of his own, and one day in March he borrowed an
axe and went into the woods which lay all around
his village, and there, on the side of a thickly wooded<span class="pagenum">252</span>
hill, he found the perfect spot on which to build his
house. At once he began to cut down the tall, straight
pines with which the hill was covered to make a
clearing, and with the purpose of using the pines as
timber for his hut. He chose the spot specially for
the view it had of the pond or lake beneath. Thoreau
says a lake is a most beautiful and expressive feature
in a landscape, and he likens it to the earth’s
eye. It was called Walden, and from all the descriptions
we read of it, it was a particularly beautiful
pond, remarkable for its depth and its clearness, like
a deep green well. Many people thought it was bottomless,
and it was more than a mile long, the hills
encircling it and rising steeply out of it on all sides.
These days in which Thoreau worked, cutting and
hewing wood, were pleasant spring days, and we can
imagine how happy he was at his labors in the open
air. He felt, he said, like a bird building its nest, and
wondered if men, were they always to build their own
homes, would become more poetical and sing as they
worked.</p>

<p>By July his house was ready to live in, though he
had not yet built his chimney—he liked in summer-time
to do his cooking out of doors. He left till later
also the plastering of his hut, so that the cool air
blew through the chinks between the logs, which was
very delicious in summer-time. From the door of his
hut a little pathway ran straight down to the pond,
and behind it he had made a clearing of some acres<span class="pagenum">253</span>
where he might grow his corn and vegetables. In
his book “Walden” Thoreau describes how he spent
his day during that first year. He would rise very
early in the morning in summer-time and take his
bath in the pond, and before the sun was high and
the dew lay on everything he would attend to the bean-field
he loved so much and hoe between the long green
rows. After this he would do his housework, which
he called a pleasant pastime. He had only a bed, a
table, a desk, three chairs, a looking-glass (three
inches across), a pair of tongs and andirons, a kettle,
a frying-pan, a wash-bowl, one or two jugs, one cup,
and a lamp.</p>

<p>When his floor was dirty, he merely set all his furniture
out of doors on the grass, dashed water on the
floor of his hut and sprinkled it with white sand, and
then with a broom swept it clean. By the time other
people were just getting up his house was dry again
and his work finished.</p>

<p>The first year at Walden he worked a great deal in
his garden. Then he had his cooking to do, and he
studied very carefully the art of making bread, baking
it at first out of doors on the end of a stick of timber
over an open fire. He made experiments and discoveries
with foods, cooking odd wild plants and
weeds. He proved that a man in that land could
support himself on what he grew. He could, for instance,
grow his own rye and Indian corn and grind<span class="pagenum">254</span>
them in a hand-mill, and sugar he could extract from
beet and pumpkins or from maples, which abound in
that country. You could avoid, he said, going to
any shops at all, and he was sure that to maintain
yourself on the earth simply and wisely was not a
hardship at all, but a pleasure.</p>

<p>Sometimes during this first year Thoreau did nothing
at all but sit in his doorway dreaming, quite undisturbed
and in silence, except for the flittering and
twittering of birds. He would not realize how the
time had flown until he saw the sunlight lighting up
his west window, or heard the sound of some horse
and wagon in the distance going home to rest. He
did not feel this to be a waste of time, for he seemed,
he said, to grow under these conditions like the corn
in the night.</p>

<p>Not very far from where he lived was a railway
line, and a train would pass at certain intervals. In
spite of his love of solitude Thoreau liked the sound
of it, and the whistle of the engine he likened to the
cry of a hawk. He would listen to the passage of
the moving train with the same feeling he had about
the rising sun. It was so punctual and regular, and
when the train had passed with its clang and clatter
Thoreau felt more alone than ever, for it had made
him feel the peacefulness and contrast of his own
solitary yet not lonely life. On Sundays he would
listen to the bells of distant towns, when the wind was<span class="pagenum">255</span>
in the right direction—the sounds would come floating
faint and sweet over the trees, as if it were the
music of the woods: so Thoreau describes it.</p>

<p>In the warm summer evenings he would spend a
good deal of time in his boat, playing the flute and
watching the fish. He would make echoes by smacking
the water with his paddle till every corner of
the wooded hills cried and answered him. Sometimes
he would fish at midnight to get something
for his next day’s dinner, and he would listen to the
owls he loved so much, and to the foxes crying, or
to the call of some mysterious night-birds; and the
fish he describes as dimpling the moonlit surface of
the water with their tails.</p>

<p>His days passed probably very quickly—if you are
contented and happy the day is all too short. Thoreau
said he hadn’t got to look for amusement anywhere,
as his life had become his amusement, it was so real
and full of interest. But he did not cut himself off
from people altogether. Sometimes he would go to
the village to hear some talk. He usually went in
the evening, and he liked to stay very late there,
especially when it was dark and stormy, because it
was so pleasant to leave some bright, warm village
room and to go out into the black night to find his
harbor in the woods. He did not mind how wild
the weather was—in fact, he preferred it wild and
often faced severe storms. Those who have never
been in the woods by night have no idea how dark
<span class="pagenum">256</span>
they can be. They would frighten and bewilder most
people, but not Thoreau. He would feel his way with
his feet on the faint track he had worn, or he would
steer with his hands, feeling particular trees and
passing between two pines, perhaps not more than
eighteen inches apart; or he might sometimes guess
his whereabouts by seeing a piece of light above him—a
glimpse of the sky through a well-remembered break
in the trees. One can understand the satisfactory and
joyful feeling of reaching at last the little hut, always
unlocked and open to any traveler who cared to enter.
When Thoreau went away for a time he left it thus,
hoping that some wayfarer might care to enter, to
sit in his chair and read the few books which lay
on his table.</p>

<p>In October, Thoreau collected his stores for the
winter. He would go a-graping, but this, he says,
more for the beauty of the grapes than for any nourishment
they gave him, and he would get wild apples
and store them, and principally he would make expeditions
to the chestnut woods, to get chestnuts,
which are a good substitute for bread. He would have
a sack on his back and a stick in his hand with which
to open the prickly burrs, and as he gathered them
up the squirrels and jays called angrily to him for
taking any of their food. Thoreau also discovered,
while digging the ground near, a sort of potato used
by the first peoples who lived in America; it had a
sweetish taste like a frostbitten potato.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">257</span></p>
<p>When visitors called on Thoreau, which they did
sometimes, he describes the manner in which, if he
were out, they would leave their cards—either a bunch
of flowers, a wreath of evergreen, or a name in pencil
on a yellow leaf or chip. If he had friends in summer
days he took them into his best room, or drawing-room,
which was the pine wood behind his house.
Travelers did sometimes come out of their way to
see Thoreau, having heard of the strange man living
in the woods, and they were curious to see him and
the inside of his hut. They would make an excuse
for calling by asking for a glass of water, and Thoreau
would direct them to the pond, where he always drank
himself, and hand them a cup. It interested him to observe
the effect the woods and solitude had on people.
Girls and boys and young women, he said, seemed
very happy to be there, but men, even farmers, thought
only of the loneliness and how far it was from somewhere,
adding that of course they enjoyed a ramble
in the woods.</p>

<p>In November of the first year he was at Walden,
Thoreau built his chimney, having studied masonry,
and he lingered about the fire-place of his house, as
being, he says, the most important part of a house.
Then he plastered the hut in freezing weather, fetching
the sand for the purpose from the shore below.
Then, he says, “I began to use it for warmth as well
as shelter.” When he had finished this work the
pond was frozen and snow covered the ground.<span class="pagenum">258</span>
Thoreau, happy and serene, retired still further into
his shell, keeping a bright fire in his house and within
his breast. All this time he wrote a good deal, and
his employment out of doors was to collect dead wood
and to drag it into his shed. He loved his woodpile,
and would build it where he could see it in front
of his window. For many weeks in the snow Thoreau
would spend cheerful evenings by his fireside, and
no visitors would come to the woods—only woodmen
came occasionally to cut and take wood on sleds back
to the village. But no weather interfered with Thoreau’s
walks. He managed to make a little pathway
by always treading on the same track, and he would
go thus in deepest snow to keep, as he expressed it,
an appointment with an old beech-tree or a birch, or
an old friend among the pines. His descriptions of
winter in the woods are perhaps more fascinating and
romantic than any other part of his “Walden,” and
he tells of the wonders of the coming spring, the gradual
melting of the ice, the longer days, the note of
some arriving bird.</p>

<p>His second year at Walden was, he said, the same
as the first, and when he left it in September he had
lived there rather over two years. He left, he said,
for as good a reason as he entered it. He does not tell
the reason, but it was an unselfish one. His father
had died, and his relations needed some one to work
for them and to make a little money; so, much as he
hated it, as we know he must have done, he returned<span class="pagenum">259</span>
to the world to make pencils and to write and to lecture
till the end of his life.</p>

<p>When Thoreau emerged from his seclusion, you can
imagine the questions he was asked by curious people
who wanted to know all about it. Why did he do it;
wasn’t he lonely; what did he do with himself; what
did he eat? So he decided to publish an account of
his experiment, filling out the diary he had written
daily at Walden, and giving his reasons for his retirement
and the conclusions he had formed about life and
the world through his experiment. He learned, he
tells us, that if you have a dream or some sort of idea
of what a perfect life should be, or anyhow the life
that appears to you to be the most lovely, the most
useful, or the most satisfactory, you should advance
quite confidently in that direction—that is to say, in
the direction of your dreams; and that if you do this
you will meet with a great deal of success. Also, that
in proportion as you simplify your life the world will
appear less complicated, you will be less poor and
less lonely; the simple natural things will never fail
to interest you, your requirements will be few, and
your life full of enjoyment. Instead of three meals a
day, eat but one; instead of a hundred dishes, five;
and reduce everything in proportion. Life, says Thoreau,
is simply frittered away by detail. And about
clothes—Thoreau describes how he asked his acquaintances
if they would appear with a neat patch on their
trousers, and most of them thought they would be dis<span class="pagenum">260</span>graced
for life. Apparently, Thoreau says, they would
rather have a broken leg than a trouser with a rent
in it. It is certain that a man’s clothes are more important
to some people than the man himself, and all
these things, to one who lives a natural life, appear
almost too absurd to be tolerated; and Thoreau, I
think, did a useful work in drawing attention to these
fallacies, which we are all inclined to take as a matter
of course.</p>

<p>But Thoreau, because he went into the woods to
live alone, did not wish every one to do so; indeed,
he thought there should be as many different kinds
of people in the world as possible. What he wanted
people to do was to find out for themselves the best
thing for themselves, and not necessarily to follow
in the footsteps of their fathers and mothers and
friends, to be Republicans because these were Republicans
or Democrats because they were Democrats,
to think as they did and to live as they did without
giving any thought at all to it. He wanted people
to have the courage to experiment and to take risks.
But he did not wish to make rules for strong, courageous
natures, nor did he wish to alter the way of
living of those who found encouragement and happiness
in their present manner of life. He did not speak
at all to those who were well employed, but he did
want to help people who complained, who were discontented
and saw life as a desert, dull and joyless and
without hope. He had in his head chiefly what he<span class="pagenum">261</span>
calls “that seemingly wealthy but most terribly impoverished
class of all,” the people who have accumulated
money and property and so have forged their
own gold and silver fetters. He was tremendously
scornful about the rich, and perhaps not pitiful
enough. On the other hand, everything he has said
against the possession of money and the futility of
luxury is so perfectly reasonable and true and without
any exaggeration, that no arguments can really be
found to meet him. A good many of us admit that
riches do not bring happiness, and that they undoubtedly
increase our responsibilities and make us less
free, but we all fail to act up to our beliefs, and continue
to wish for more money in order to have a
larger house, more servants, more clothes—and thus,
as Thoreau says, we become “the tools of our tools”
and the slaves of our own helpers and servants; in fact,
these things are a hindrance to our development.
“Superfluous wealth can buy superfluities only.
Money is not required to buy one necessary of the
soul.” This is one of Thoreau’s maxims. It was certainly
easier for Thoreau than for some to live a perfectly
natural life in the woods. He had not been
brought up in luxury. What he named luxuries we
most of us call comforts. He was frugal by training
as well as by inclination. Therefore in criticizing as
he did the life that is led by most people in the world
he was not very generous, because he had never felt
their temptations. He was, some have thought, hardly<span class="pagenum">262</span>
human. In fact, he had very few weaknesses, and to
be almost perfect is not a very attractive quality. We
like to find imperfections in people and faults like our
own. Thoreau was very little troubled by indecisions
or doubts as to whether a thing was right or wrong
for himself. He was quite sure of what he wanted;
he went to look for it, and he found it. He was determined
to improve himself, to be good and to be
happy, and he succeeded. Even when he was dying
of consumption he said in a letter he was enjoying
existence as much as ever. When he believed in things
he believed in them wholly, and principally he believed
in the invigorating power of nature. He loved books;
he loved writing and wood-cutting and walks in the
country. He has written a delightful essay on walking,
and has told us that he wrote in proportion to
his rambles—if he was shut up indoors he could not
write at all. He liked, too, association with simple,
genuine people who were spending their lives in the
open—fishermen, woodmen, and sometimes farmers—so
that it cannot be said that he was a misanthropist—one
who hates his fellow-creatures; if they were real
and natural he enjoyed them and cared for them, but
he had not got to depend on human beings for his entertainment.
His interests and resources lay within
himself, and he could always fall back on nature.
“You may,” he says, “have some pleasant, thrilling,
glorious hours even in a poorhouse. The setting sun
is reflected from the windows of the almshouse as<span class="pagenum">263</span>
brightly as from the rich man’s abode. The snow
melts before its door as early in the spring.”</p>

<p>Thoreau’s enjoyment was calm and level. From
his writings we do not gather that he was ever desperately
unhappy, unless it was perhaps in a crowded
street or in a luxurious drawing-room. He did mind
very much the struggle and bustle, the ugliness of
city life and all it stands for. It had a bad, cramping
effect upon him, and he shunned it. Once back again
in his woods and fields, his whole nature expanded.
On cheerless, bleak days, when he was out of doors
and the villagers would be thinking of their inn, he
would, he says, come to himself and feel himself to
be part of it all. “This cold and solitude are friends
of mine.” In the country and alone he would see
things as they are, “grand and beautiful,” and forget
“all trivial men and things.” The stillness and solitude
inspired him. His brain and mind worked and
his nerves were steadied.</p>

<p>To some, Thoreau appeared to have a cold personality.
One man said of him he would as soon think
of taking his arm as taking the arm of an elm-tree.
“You could not,” said Carlyle, “nestle up to him.”
There are others who put a man down as a coward
if he runs away from the world as it is, and does not
face it and make the best of it. On this question
there must always be a good deal of dispute, but it is
really rather an absurd thing to argue about, because
we are all made so differently. What is one man’s<span class="pagenum">264</span>
meat is another man’s poison. One person may not
physically be able to stand a certain climate, but
finds another to suit him, and so, as regards a man’s
nature, he must discover how he may make the best
of himself in order to develop his character and disposition.
Thoreau’s argument was that if you cannot
put a great proportion of your powers and enthusiasm
into what you are doing, it is not of much
use to yourself or mankind. He valued a man’s work
in proportion to how much it enlarged and improved
his soul.</p>

<p>To those who remain to fight in the hurly-burly
while saying they dislike it, it probably has some bracing
quality of which they are conscious, but Thoreau,
as we have seen, felt himself in the streets to be
“cheap and mean.” So he helped in his own way.
To have forced him to sit on an office stool or to have
a regular profession would have been a crime. If
he had been more conventional and less peculiar,
“Walden” would never have been written. Besides,
he saw for what futile and ignoble reasons men chose
their professions; sometimes not even because they
had to make a living or to keep a wife and children,
but for the sake of having expensive cigars and wines,
a man-servant or a large house; and for these things,
he observed, people will toil and make others toil at
some stupid or sordid work, leaving themselves no
time for thought, for true friendship, or for the enjoyment
of books or nature or any real things. “There is<span class="pagenum">265</span>
no more fatal blunderer,” says Thoreau, “than he who
consumes the greater part of his life getting his living.”
He calculated for himself that six weeks’ work
would bring him in all the money he required to live.
So that the whole of his winter and most of his summer
would be free for study and enjoyment of country
life. But it must not be thought that Thoreau
was lazy or had never worked himself. In early days
he had perfected himself in the craft of pencil-making
and surveying. He had also worked very hard at his
writing. He had learned industry, and in everything
that he did he showed a peculiar thoroughness and
skill.</p>

<p>If we want to find fault with Thoreau, it must be
that he was perhaps too bent on improving himself.
Thoreau and Emerson both believed very strongly in
the importance of making oneself more interesting.
Thoreau had a corresponding horror of consciously
<i>doing good</i> to people, and of philanthropy generally.
“Philanthropy,” he says, “is almost the only virtue
which is sufficiently appreciated by mankind”; and
again, “If you give money spend yourself with it.
Do not merely abandon it to them” (the poor).</p>

<p>There are those who accuse Thoreau of being odd
on purpose, and speak of his writing as paradoxical.
It is much more likely that we who are doing and
thinking exactly like our neighbors, without thinking
if it is a good thing in itself, are the odd ones, or
rather the lazy ones, because we cannot be bothered<span class="pagenum">266</span>
to disagree, to incur the disapproval of our friends,
or to have them laughing at us. Emerson said that
in life you must choose between Truth and Repose.
By repose he means that you swallow your convictions
for the sake of a quiet life—that you act always
with the majority, or largest number of people, and
shout with the biggest crowd. It is very comfortable
to have people agreeing with you, and to live at ease
and in accord with your neighbors, but to do this you
must make up your mind to think very little and never
to have a cause too much at heart, or you will be
sure to offend somebody. You must shut your eyes to
the horrors of war, of poverty, of hungry children, and
say it is no use bothering or criticizing, as these
things cannot be remedied. The man who says they
can be remedied is often looked upon with suspicion
or contempt, and even anger. All the greatest men
and women have given their allegiance to truth, as
we know by reading history. Thoreau was one of
these. He lived at the beginning of the nineteenth
century, when people were no longer sent to the stake
for holding independent views, but they were made,
as they still are now, to suffer all the same. Thoreau,
like Garrison and Tolstoy and others of our heroes,
thought that conscience should be above the State, and
that men should be men first and subjects afterwards.
But he was much more consistent than most people.
He put himself to a great deal of trouble to carry out
his principles. It was not enough for him to preach<span class="pagenum">267</span>
against the things he disapproved of—he lived and
acted his disapproval. He pleaded in public for John
Brown when he was condemned to death, and went
to prison for a night for refusing to pay a tax in support
of what he considered an unjust war. He did
not enjoy this; it was a trouble and a bother, but
Thoreau did what he thought right.</p>

<p>His was a pure and courageous spirit; he never said
a thing for the sake of pleasing, and he saw with a
clear, unprejudiced eye the futility, the stupidity, the
waste of energy, and the sadness of much we have come
to look upon as part of existence itself. But Thoreau
was always, to the end of his rather short life, full of
hope and trust. He would set about improving things
by improving himself. His greatness lay in his originality
and independence of character. He thrashed
out questions for himself, and threw a fresh and illuminating
light on them. He was a rebel in his quiet
way, as Garibaldi or Cromwell were rebels on the field
of battle.</p>

TOLSTOY<br /><br />

1828–1910</h2>



<p><small>The true life is the common life of all—not the life of the one.
All must labor for the life of others.</small><br /><br /></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Tolstoy</span>, one of the greatest novelists and the greatest
thinkers of the nineteenth century, was a Russian.</p>

<p>His father, Count Nicholas Tolstoy, and his mother,
Princess Marie Volkonsky, were both aristocrats,
whose ancestors had been well known and important
people for some generations.</p>

<p>Yasnaya Polyana (which means “Bright Glade”),
where Leo Tolstoy was born, belonged to his mother.
It was a very pretty place, and consisted of a large
wooden house surrounded by woods and avenues of
lime-trees, and with a river and four lakes and a lot
of property belonging to it.</p>

<p>Tolstoy’s mother died when he was a year and a
half old, so he could not remember her; but all he
heard about her made him love her memory. He tells
us that she appeared to him as “a creature so elevated,
fine, and spiritual,” that often, during his struggles
to be good and overcome temptation, he prayed<span class="pagenum">270</span>
to her soul to help him, and that such prayer always
did. She seems to have been a gifted and delightful
woman, speaking five languages and playing the piano
exceptionally well. She had a gift for telling stories
too. At balls, it is said, her young girl-friends would
leave the dance and gather together in a dark room
to hear her tell a story, for the Princess had to have
the room darkened or she felt shy.</p>

<p>Tolstoy’s mother was hot-tempered, yet self-controlled.
She was generous and hardly ever condemned
anybody, and she was very truthful. Her son
Leo inherited many of her qualities.</p>

<p>Tolstoy lost his father when he was nine years old,
but he remembered him quite well, and writes of him
as a good, conscientious man, who spent his life looking
after his estate, not very cleverly, but who was
especially humane and kind for those days, as he
never beat his serfs and was considered lacking in
firmness. He was, however, an independent-minded
man, who refused to bow down before the will of the
Russian Government: indeed, he refused always to
serve under it. Tolstoy had a great love and admiration
for his father, but nothing like the feeling he had
for the memory of his mother.</p>

<div class="caption">TOLSTOY IN 1906<br />

From Aylmer Maude’s “Life of Tolstoy”</div>
</div>

<p>Tolstoy and his three brothers and a sister were
brought up at Yasnaya Polyana by a distant relative,
whom they called Aunt Tatiana. She was rather a
remarkable character, and Leo was devoted to her.
He tells us she greatly helped to form his character.
<span class="pagenum">271</span>Writing about her, he says: “Aunt Tatiana had the
greatest influence on my life. From earliest childhood
she taught me the spiritual delight of love. She
taught me this joy not by words, but by her whole
being she filled me with love. I saw, <i>I felt</i> how she
enjoyed loving, and I understood the joy of love. This
was the first thing. Secondly, she taught me the delights
of an unhurried, quiet life.”</p>

<p>His aunt used to welcome all sorts of pilgrims to
Yasnaya, beggars and monks and nuns, people despised
by the rest of the world, so that Leo was
brought up in a strange, almost mediæval atmosphere—an
atmosphere that was religious, poetical, simple,
and very far from worldly. We find Tolstoy after
a long life of varied experiences returning again to the
habits and beliefs of his youth, and to a life of humility
and simple living.</p>

<p>Tolstoy had the greatest admiration for his eldest
brother Nicholas, who, he always said, was a much
greater man than himself; but Nicholas died before
he had time to show what he was capable of. This
brother invented a game called “Ant Brothers.” He
told Leo and his two brothers of six and seven that
he possessed a secret and, when it was known, all
men would become happy; there would be no more
disease, no trouble, and no one would be angry with
any one else; all would love one another and become
“ant brothers.” The game consisted of sitting under
chairs surrounded by boxes, screening themselves<span class="pagenum">272</span>
from view with handkerchiefs, and cuddling against
one another in the dark. Tolstoy says: “The ‘ant
brotherhood’ was revealed to us, but not the chief
secret: the way for all men to cease suffering any misfortune,
to leave off quarreling and being angry, and
become continuously happy: this secret Nicholas said
he had written on a green stick and buried by the
road at the edge of a certain ravine, at which spot
(since my body must be buried somewhere) I have
asked to be buried in memory of Nicholas.”</p>

<p>Writing when he was over seventy, Tolstoy says:
“The ideal of ant brothers lovingly clinging to one
another, though not under two armchairs curtained
by handkerchiefs, but of all mankind under the wide
dome of heaven, has remained the same for me. As
I then believed that there existed a little green stick,
whereon was written the message which could destroy
all evil in men and give them universal welfare, so I
now believe that such truth exists, and will be revealed
to men and will give them all it promises.”</p>

<p>Tolstoy’s early childhood was on the whole very
happy, in spite of his far-seeing, sensitive, and rather
morbid nature. At times he was certainly very miserable,
but, on the other hand, he had an immense
power of enjoyment, and loved games and horses and
dogs and the country itself, and his affections were
very strong.</p>

<p>One of the things that worried him as a child was
his own looks; he thought himself so plain. He says<span class="pagenum">273</span>
in his autobiographical novel “Childhood”: “I imagined
there could be no happiness on earth for a man
with so broad a nose, such thick lips, and such small
gray eyes as mine. I asked God to perform a miracle
and change me into a handsome boy....” He tried
to improve his appearance by clipping his eyebrows,
with most disastrous results, as of course he was uglier
and unhappier than ever.</p>

<p>Tolstoy showed no particular talent for anything
as a child, though he was very original, and quite
determined not to do things like other people. When
he came into the drawing-room, for instance, he insisted
upon bowing to people backwards, bending his
head the wrong way, and saluting each person thus
in turn. He was not good at his lessons, and mentions
somewhere that a student who came to teach
him and his brothers said about them: “Serge both
wishes and can, Dmitry wishes but can’t (This was
not true), and Leo neither wishes nor can (This I
think was perfectly true).” This was characteristic
of Tolstoy, who was always hard on himself. But if
the tutor lived to see what Tolstoy became, he must
have been rather ashamed of his lack of perception.</p>

<p>Before Tolstoy was sixteen he entered a university
with his brothers. There was no doubt that, like many
other young people, he hated study, though he worked
hard and passed well in languages. In history and
geography he failed, and being asked to name the
French seaports, he could not remember a single one.<span class="pagenum">274</span>
He left the university rather disgusted with himself
and despising intellectual things. His companions
had not really understood him, for he was a strange
mixture. Sometimes he was very proud and aristocratic,
yet with advanced Liberal views; and he was
moody, at one moment wildly gay, at another sunk
in gloom. He always looked upon the worst side of
himself, and wrote in his diary that he was awkward,
uncleanly, irritable, a bore to others, ignorant, intolerant,
and shamefaced as a child: there was no end to
the names he called himself. He admits that he is
honest and that he loves goodness, but on the whole
he is very unfair to himself, for the reason that he
had set up such a high ideal to live up to.</p>

<p>Now he intended, though only nineteen, to devote
himself to his peasants. He went back to his property
with great zeal for reform. He knew of the sufferings
of the serfs, the famines and revolts. For a time
he worked among them and learned to know all about
their lives. But he was too young, and lacked patience
at present to do much good. After six months, rather
discouraged and disappointed, he was off on a different
experience. He made his home now at St. Petersburg,
where he was most frivolous and idle. He understood
quite well what a stupid life he was leading,
and in a religious book he wrote in after years,
called “My Confession,” he says that though he honestly
desired to be good, he stood alone in his search
after goodness. Every time he expressed the longings<span class="pagenum">275</span>
of his heart for a virtuous life, he met with contempt
and mocking laughter, but every time he was frivolous
or wicked, he was praised and encouraged.</p>

<p>Yet on the whole this gay life at St. Petersburg
was not altogether useless. It taught him something,
and he was not really spoilt by it. He was big enough
and intelligent enough to see the utter futility and
uselessness of such a life. It gave him, he says, a
scorn for aristocracy and the life of rich people generally,
whose whole existence was “a mania of selfishness.”</p>

<p>Tolstoy’s favorite brother Nicholas, who was serving
in the Russian army, saw what an unsatisfactory
state his brother was in, and so persuaded Leo to become
a soldier and join him in the Caucasus. This
Leo was only too glad to do. He says in a letter at
that time, “God willing, I will amend and become
a steady man at last.”</p>

<p>Now, the open-air, primitive life in this part of
Russia quite restored Tolstoy to himself, and he began
to write. His first book, “Childhood,” was written
and published while he was there. This novel,
though not strictly speaking a history of his own
childhood, is mostly about his own youthful life; the
incidents that occur in it are many of them true, and
the characters are taken from friends and relatives.
It is a very wonderful book, as showing how vividly
Tolstoy remembered his own feelings as a child, how
intensely he must have felt and suffered, and what<span class="pagenum">276</span>
his powers of thought and observation must have
been. He continued this book, and brought out later
other volumes entitled “Boyhood” and “Youth.”
They are all three full of beautiful things. Tolstoy
also wrote about the Caucasus, a novel called “The
Cossacks,” a romantic story of the strange, wild people
who inhabit this part of Russia.</p>

<p>At the time of the Crimean War, Tolstoy experienced
as a soldier the horrors of battle. He was
at the siege of Sebastopol, and wrote the book of that
name. It made a great sensation when it came out,
soon after the war was over. Its profound understanding
of the feelings of men who were constantly
facing death and danger, and of those who were dying,
made a deep impression on people.</p>

<p>Tolstoy, from seeing war, formed his very strong
opinions against it. He became from that time one of
the most passionate apostles of peace. He saw how
much that is splendid is sometimes brought out in
people who face the terrors of war, but, on the other
hand, he saw its fearful uselessness, the waste of noble
human beings, the suffering it causes everywhere, and
the destruction, in some, of all human feeling. “It
is not suffering and death that are terrible,” says
Tolstoy, “but that which allows people to inflict suffering
and death.”</p>

<p>Tolstoy after Sebastopol left the army and went
back to St. Petersburg, this time to live in a literary
circle, where he was welcomed by distinguished au<span class="pagenum">277</span>thors
as the most promising writer of the day. Nobody,
after reading “Childhood” or “Sebastopol,”
could fail to see Tolstoy’s marvelous genius for seeing
things as they are, and his gift of expression. But he
grew impatient in this circle, for his views were too
advanced and his love of truth too strong. He could
not agree with people, and he could not pretend to
agree with them. So he was thought quarrelsome and
conceited, and his opinions absurd. He was always
questioning things, such as the meaning of existence,
and whether he himself was of any use; he would
take nothing as a matter of course. Already, before
he was twenty-seven, he had conceived the great idea
of devoting his life to founding a new Religion—the
Religion of Christianity, in fact, but cleansed of all
its dogmas, which have nothing to do with Christianity:
a practical religion, giving happiness on earth,
not merely the promise of future happiness.</p>

<p>And another great question absorbed him, the question
of emancipating the serfs. Peasants who worked
on the land in Russia were held much as slaves, and
were the absolute property of their masters, forced
to work for them so many days a week before they
might do any work for themselves. Tolstoy violently
took the side of the peasants in all that concerned
them, and his purpose in life was more or less fixed
from this time onward. Like our other great man
of noble birth, William of Orange, who worked on
the side of the people, he was determined to leave<span class="pagenum">278</span>
no stone unturned until the conditions of the poor
had been improved and justice done them.</p>

<p>Now, in order to learn more of the habits and customs
of other countries, and principally their systems
of education, Tolstoy went abroad and visited France,
Germany, and England. Then, returning to his home,
he settled down as a land-owner and managed his own
estates.</p>

<p>In 1861 the serfs were liberated by the Czar Alexander
II.</p>

<p>Tolstoy, with characteristic energy and enthusiasm,
flung himself into the work of dividing out lands between
nobles and peasants. He acted as a judge in
his own district, and annoyed his aristocratic neighbors
by being fair to the poor: he had seen too often
how they had been cheated out of their rights.</p>

<p>It was difficult, rather discouraging work, because
years of oppression had made the peasants suspicious
and grasping, and Tolstoy’s task was to try to remove
this distrust. He became more and more socialistic,
and his literary friends were very much disappointed
in him, for he seemed to be giving up his writing. One
wrote: “Tolstoy has grown a long beard, leaves his
hair to fall in curls over his ears, holds newspapers
in detestation, and has no soul for anything but his
property.”</p>

<p>Tolstoy had also started on another enterprise.
This was a school after his own theories at Yasnaya
and a monthly magazine which he printed and edited,<span class="pagenum">279</span>
all about his views on education. He saw how most
learning is mechanical, and how a child does not learn
because he wants to, but in order not to be punished,
or to earn a prize, or to be better than others, but
very seldom from a real desire to know. This Tolstoy
considered was because the child was so drilled
and made to behave unnaturally, and to have a different
manner in school than he had out. He was
not free, and only when a child was free and natural
and lively, and allowed to ask questions and to laugh
and talk, could he learn with pleasure and therefore
thoroughly. In Tolstoy’s school there was no order as
we know it: children sat on the floor or bunches of
them in an arm-chair; they did just as they pleased,
and ran about from place to place. They answered
questions, not in turn but all together, interrupting
one another or helping one another to remember. If
one child left out a bit of story that he had to tell,
another jumped up and put it in.</p>

<p>Tolstoy encouraged the children not to repeat literally
what they had heard, but to tell “out of your
own head.” As there were very few reading books
for young children, Tolstoy wrote stories for them
himself, which, as they have been translated into English,
we are able to read ourselves and to judge how
they must have delighted his small pupils. He also
read to them and explained to them Bible stories, of
which he was very fond.</p>

<p>There was no doubt that Tolstoy had a gift for
<span class="pagenum">280</span>
teaching and interested the children as no ordinary
teacher could. His methods are not for every one.</p>

<p>Tolstoy’s classes came to an end after two years,
because he was interfered with by the Government;
but he revived them at intervals during his life, and
there is no doubt that his views on education helped
to make teaching in Russia more reasonable and natural,
and put fresh ideas about it into people’s heads.</p>

<p>Tolstoy’s only companion at this time was his aunt
Tatiana, but in 1862, when he was thirty-four, he married
Miss Sophia Behrs, who was only eighteen. He
had known her as a little girl.</p>

<p>Tolstoy now settled down to a very happy life—the
life, indeed, which had been his ideal, and which
he had described as such in a letter to his aunt, when
quite a young man. He pictures himself living with
his wife at Yasnaya—</p>



<p class="small">A gentle creature, kind and affectionate, she has the
same love for you as I have; you live upstairs in the big
house, in what used to be Grandmamma’s room; the whole
house is as it was in Papa’s time.... I take Papa’s
place, though I despair of ever deserving it. My wife
that of Mamma; the children take ours. If they made
me Emperor of Russia or gave me Peru—in a word, if
a fairy came with her wand asking me what I wished
for, I should reply that I only wished that this dream
may become reality.</p>

<p>And all this actually came to pass. Aunt Tatiana,
when Tolstoy married, continued to live with him.
<span class="pagenum">281</span>
He had many children, managed his estates, taught
the peasants, and wrote books, and though he was
not living in the same house in which he was born,
for the large wooden house had been removed and sold
to pay his father’s debts, he lived on the same spot
in the stone one erected in its place. His wife helped
in everything, in spite of her large family, for they
had thirteen children. She found time to copy out
all her husband’s manuscripts, which to most people
would have been as impossible a task as looking for
a needle in a haystack, they were so extraordinarily
badly written, and scratched out and rewritten. His
first great novel, “War and Peace,” one of the longest
novels in existence, is said to have been copied out
by Countess Tolstoy seven times.</p>

<p>Tolstoy always lived with his children, and did not
banish them to nurseries and schoolrooms, as some
people do. Up to the age of ten they were taught
by their father and mother; their mother taught them
Russian and music, and their father arithmetic and
French. Most entertaining French it was, which consisted
of reading amusing stories out of illustrated
volumes of Jules Verne. If there happened to be a
volume without pictures, Tolstoy made the pictures
himself. He drew very badly, yet his pictures were
so amusing that the children liked them much better
than the ordinary ones.</p>

<p>He would discuss and explain interesting things
with his children, and they were always eager to be<span class="pagenum">282</span>
with him, to go walks with him, and be on his side
in any game he taught them. Clearing the snow off
the ponds in winter under their father’s direction was
even more amusing than the skating itself. They
rode and hunted with their father, for in the earlier
part of his life Tolstoy was an enthusiastic sportsman.
He was brave, daring, and an excellent shot,
and he enjoyed more than anything being out in the
open air.</p>

<p>In the early morning, before breakfast, Tolstoy
would usually go for a long walk, or ride down to
bathe in the river. At morning coffee, or what we
call breakfast, the family all met together, and Tolstoy
was always very merry. He would be up to all
sorts of jokes, till he got up with the words, “One
must get to work,” and off he went to his study to
write books, and he would work for many hours on
end, though in summer he would often come out and
play with the children. This always delighted them,
as he brought such spirit and interest into their games,
and he would invent new ones himself—which were
better than any. If they had secrets, he always
guessed them, so that they regarded him as a sort
of magician. His son writes of him: “My father
hardly ever made us do anything, but it always somehow
came about that of our own initiative we did
exactly what he wanted us to. My mother often
scolded us and punished us, but when my father
wanted us to do anything, he merely looked us hard<span class="pagenum">283</span>
in the eyes, and we understood—the look was far more
effective than any command. It was impossible to
hide anything from him, as impossible as to hide it
from your own conscience. He knew everything, and
to deceive him was nearly impossible and quite useless.”</p>

<p>This same son, Ilya, Tolstoy’s second boy, tells
many amusing stories of the Tolstoy family life, and
of the great part his father played in it. One story
is as follows: Ilya, when a little boy, was given a
big china cup and saucer by his mother at Christmas-time.
He was so excited that he ran very fast to show
it to the others, and as he ran from one room to another,
he caught his foot on the step in the doorway
and fell down and broke his cup to smithereens. When
accused by his mother of being careless, he howled
and said it was not his fault, but the fault of the
beastly architect who had gone and put a step in the
doorway. Tolstoy, overhearing him, was much
amused, and said, “It is the architect’s fault, it is the
architect’s fault!” This phrase became a saying in
the family, and Tolstoy was always using it when any
one threw the blame on any one else. When one of
the children fell off his horse because he stumbled,
or when he did his lessons badly because his tutor
had not explained them properly, and so on, “Of
course, I know,” Tolstoy would say; “it is the architect’s
fault.”</p>

<p>Tolstoy had some excellent inventions for making<span class="pagenum">284</span>
his children cheerful. When they would all be sitting
rather cross and bored after the departure of
some dull visitors, he would suddenly jump up from
his seat, and, lifting one arm in the air with its hand
hanging loose from the wrist, run at full speed round
the table at a hopping gallop. Every one rose and
flew after him, hopping and waving their hands. They
went round the room several times, and then sat down
again in their chairs, panting, and quite gay and lively
once more. This game, which was known as “Numidian
Cavalry,” had an excellent effect, and many a
time the children’s tears were dried by it and quarrels
forgotten.</p>

<p>Tolstoy, amongst other things, enjoyed music, and
was fond of playing duets on the piano. After dinner
he would settle down to this, usually with his
wife’s sister. When he was in difficulties he would
say things to make her laugh, so that she had to
play slower, and sometimes, if this did not succeed,
he would stop and take off one of his boots, saying,
“Now it will go all right.”</p>

<p>Tolstoy was as young as anybody in his love of
fun and games, the more nonsensical the better; and
his laughter was most infectious, beginning on a high
note, and his whole body would shake.</p>

<p>People ought to know about this amusing side of
Tolstoy’s character, in order to get out of their heads
that he was a painfully serious man without a sense
of humor, who asked impossibilities of people. He<span class="pagenum">285</span>
had many sides to his character, as we shall see, and
that is what makes him so intensely interesting.</p>

<p>Tolstoy was a deeply affectionate man, loving above
all things his home, his wife, and his children. If
ever he had to leave them for a time, even if it were
only on a hunting expedition, he would always as he
approached his home say, “If only all is well at
home!” Whatever he did, he did with his whole
heart and soul. He was an enthusiastic schoolmaster,
a keen sportsman and farmer, and an excellent
gardener and beekeeper. He looked into everything
on his estate and insisted upon having all his pigs
washed, and there were as many as three hundred!</p>

<p>So Tolstoy’s life was as full as it possibly could
be. For the first ten years of his married life he
was so much occupied with the cares of family life,
and the life of a country gentleman, that he had less
time for thought and did not worry himself quite so
much about the reasons of life. He was also absorbed
in his writing, and being a perfect giant for work,
was able during this period—in spite of his numberless
activities—to write two very great novels, besides
many shorter stories and primers for children.</p>

<p>“War and Peace,” an historical novel of the time
of Napoleon, and requiring an immense amount of
research, and “Anna Karenina” are as great as any
novels that have been written in any country. Tolstoy’s
extraordinary powers of observation and his
acute, almost uncanny, understanding of human na<span class="pagenum">286</span>ture,
make his characters so living and human that,
having read about them, they become as people you
have known, and you can never forget them.</p>

<p>Also, Tolstoy’s experience of life was wide and varied,
and everything he wrote about he had himself
known and seen. War in the Crimea, fashionable life
in St. Petersburg, life with gipsies in the Caucasus,
with peasants in the country, the joys and sorrows
of intimate family life with children and animals—nothing
escaped his notice, and his books are simply
life seen through the medium of his wonderful and
penetrating mind; there is nothing like them.</p>

<p>So there he was, the most brilliant and successful
writer of the day, with a happy domestic life, money,
a delightful property, and devoted servants and tenants.
If any one ought to have been contented, it
might be said it was Tolstoy. And yet he became dissatisfied
and began again, as he had in earlier days,
to find fault with himself and with his own life. He
was fifty when the change in him began to take place;
and yet it was no change really, he had always been
the same; and the people who amuse themselves by
finding inconsistencies in his character are wrong
when they accuse him of being changeable: he merely
returned now to his earliest ideals, which had been
there all the time, though his intense enjoyment of
life and his many occupations had prevented his thinking
quite so much of working out his theories. It will
be seen that Tolstoy had an extraordinary tenacity of<span class="pagenum">287</span>
purpose, and during his life carried through nearly
all he had dreamed of doing. About the big and important
things of life he remained always the same,
though at times his high spirits made it appear as
though he had forgotten about the problems that had
worried him. But now, once more the question of how
to lead the best life, and what is meant by religion,
became uppermost in his mind, and a great disgust
seized him of the life he and his family were leading.
Everything he had enjoyed he now despised. He
hated the luxury of his life, the fact of having servants
to wait on him, his daughters in muslin dresses
drinking tea: “The life of our circle of society,”
he said, “not only repelled me, but lost all meaning.”</p>

<p>Yet there was nothing grossly luxurious or selfish
about the life led by the Tolstoy family: according
to most aristocratic ideas of luxury their life was
simple. Nothing could be plainer than the house at
Yasnaya, solidly built as it was, with double windows
to keep out the cold and large Dutch stoves. The
rooms were very bare and the floors mostly uncarpeted,
the furniture faded and old-fashioned. But
the family fed well, and kept a great many servants,
which seemed necessary, as the Tolstoys, like many
Russians, had hosts of poor relations living with
them, besides tutors, governesses, and old servants;
they were also a very large family in themselves.</p>

<p>But now life appeared to Tolstoy as dust and ashes.<span class="pagenum">288</span>
His wife and children, the praise of men, art—he
turned from it all. His family at first could not
understand why he should be in such despair; it was
difficult to feel sympathy with his sufferings. To
them he appeared to possess everything that most people
considered good and desirable, and the life he
was leading excellent and blameless. So they could
not help him, and he had to suffer alone.</p>

<p>Tolstoy’s second son, who has written his recollections
of his father, says he began to notice a change
in his habits about this time. He left off hunting
and shooting and riding, and took instead long walks
on the road, where he could meet pilgrims and beggars
and have talks with them. At dinner he would
tell his family about them. He became gloomy and
irritable, and quarreled with his wife over trifles. He
no longer played with his children. When they were
enjoying themselves acting or playing croquet he
would walk in and spoil it all by a word or even a
look.</p>

<p>He did not want to spoil their fun, but for all that
he did. He had often not said anything, but he had
thought it. “We all knew what he had thought, and
that was what made us so uncomfortable,” his son
says.</p>

<p>It was trying for the children to lose their jolly,
delightful companion, who had brought such zest into
their games and whose gaiety had been so infectious.<span class="pagenum">289</span>
Now they rather dreaded the appearance of this stern
man who disapproved of them.</p>

<p>He did nothing but blame the useless lives led by
ladies and gentlemen, their laziness, greed, and the
way they made other people work for them.</p>

<p>This is the sort of thing he said:</p>



<p class="small">Here we sit in our well-heated rooms, and this very
day a man was found frozen to death on the high-road.
He was frozen to death because no one would give him a
night’s lodging.<br /><br />

We stuff ourselves with cutlets and pastry while people
are dying by thousands from famine.</p>

<p>The children understood what he said, but it spoiled
all their childish amusements and broke up their
happy life.</p>

<p>Tolstoy was very unhappy for a period of four or
five years and could see no meaning in existence. But
at last he discovered a purpose in life and a religion
to help him. It was really Christianity, and Christ’s
Sermon on the Mount became his gospel. The life
of a Russian peasant he was convinced was the example
of how to live. Man, he thought, should be
simple, hardworking, and kind; he should give more
than he received and he should rejoice in serving
others. Tolstoy saw it was no good preaching without
practising, and so he tried to live like a Russian
peasant. He ate very little and lived principally<span class="pagenum">290</span>
upon vegetables. He dressed like a peasant too, in
summer in a smock and in the winter in a sheepskin
coat and cap and high boots. He refused to have any
one to wait on him, and did his own room. This
was not easy to him, as, though he had always hated
luxury, as an aristocrat he had taken certain things
for granted, such as the fact that his clothes would
always be folded and brushed and put away by a servant.
By nature he was very untidy, and it was really
an effort to him to pick up his things and keep them
in order. In earlier days, when he had dressed and
undressed, he let all his clothes tumble on to the floor,
and there they would lie in different parts of the room
until they were picked up. To see him pack his portmanteau
for a journey was said to be an unforgettable
sight, the confusion and disorder was something so
hopeless. But now he tried to turn over a new leaf
so as not to give people trouble.</p>

<p>Tolstoy saw the utter uselessness of preaching what
you never intend to practise. He was quite determined
to carry out all he asked others to do. After
all it is more by the life you lead and example rather
than by words that you persuade people, and Tolstoy
tells a true story in this connection. It is as follows:</p>

<p>The Tolstoy family took into their house a dirty,
homeless little boy, to teach him and to benefit him
generally. “What,” asks Tolstoy, “did the boy see
and learn?”</p>

<p>He saw Tolstoy’s own children, older than himself<span class="pagenum">291</span>
and of his own age, dirtying and spoiling things,
breaking and spilling things, and throwing food to
the dogs which seemed to the boy delicacies, expecting
other people to wait on them and never doing any
work themselves. Tolstoy understood then, he says,
how absurd it was to take poor people into your house
and educate them, when you were yourselves leading
such idle, useless lives.</p>

<p>Tolstoy says his one desire was to hide their life
from the boy; everything that he told him or tried to
teach him he felt was destroyed by the example they
were all setting him.</p>

<p>So Tolstoy tried hard to live according to his ideals,
and became something like a monk but without a
monk’s narrow views and superstitious beliefs. He
dropped his title quite naturally, and when a peasant
called him “Your Excellency,” Tolstoy replied, “I
am called simply Leo Nikolayevitch,” and went on
to speak of the matter in hand. Manual labor, which
had always been a pleasure to him, now became a sort
of religion. Every day he worked for hours at hay-making,
plowing, reaping or wood-cutting as the
case might be. Nothing absorbed him like mowing,
and he would stand among the peasants in his smock
listening with perfect happiness to the sound of
scythes. Country life, labor, healthy appetite and
sound sleep was his idea of a happy life.</p>

<p>In the winter evenings Tolstoy learned to make
boots. He engaged a black-bearded shoemaker to come<span class="pagenum">292</span>
and teach him, and side by side they sat on two stools
in a little room near Tolstoy’s study.</p>

<p>Tolstoy was never satisfied until he had done the
job exactly as the shoemaker did it. Groaning with
the effort of threading a waxed thread, he would refuse
the assistance of the bearded man. “I’ll do it!—No,
no—I’ll do it myself, it’s the only way to learn,”
he would say.</p>

<p>As to the boots which Tolstoy made, a man to whom
he had given a pair and who had worn them, was
asked whether they were well made. “Couldn’t be
worse,” was his reply.</p>

<p>Now for a time the whole Tolstoy family and their
friends were filled with this enthusiasm for outdoor
work. They rose early, and in company with the peasants
the Tolstoy children and their mother, in a Russian
dress, uncles, aunts, and even grandmothers,
mowed the grass and strove to outdo the other. They
had no theories about it, but simply found it a change
and a pleasant satisfactory way of taking exercise.</p>

<p>All sorts of people now made pilgrimages to Yasnaya,
to learn how to live, for Tolstoy’s fame as a
teacher had begun to go about the land. Rich aristocrats
wanted to throw away their gold and do the
housework, and a governess of the Tolstoys, who has
written rather malicious though amusing accounts of
Tolstoy’s life at this time, describes enthusiastic ladies
who came to Yasnaya and manured the fields in white
dressing jackets!<span class="pagenum">293</span>
Tolstoy suffered from the silliness of some of his
followers, and once sadly said he supposed he should
be known through them and their eccentricities.
There is a good deal of truth in the saying that a
man’s admirers are sometimes his worst enemies.</p>

<p>Tolstoy gave up writing novels, and wrote only one
more, “Resurrection,” quite at the end of his life.
This was written with a great moral purpose, and is
a serious and terrible book. His earlier novels he now
referred to as “wordy rubbish”; he hated them, as
he felt they were frivolous and could only be interesting
to the upper classes. He wrote, however, a great
many books on life, conduct, and religion, and children’s
stories. They were printed very cheaply and
taken round by pedlars. The peasants read and loved
these books, and they seemed to penetrate right into
the heart of Russia. They were written simply, and
the peasants understood them. Tolstoy was very
happy that he had been able to help and please the
poor people.</p>

<p>Now, preaching as Tolstoy did against property
and the extraordinarily unfair system which allows
one man to have a thousand acres and another not
even a foot, he could not satisfy himself until he had
got rid of his own property; so difficulties arose with
his family. His wife would not have felt so strongly
about it, no doubt, if she had had only herself to think
of; but it is difficult for a mother to believe that her
children will be happier and better without money<span class="pagenum">294</span>
and possessions; she did not want to see her children
impoverished. Tolstoy thought a mother’s love was
selfish, and often writes about it in this sense.</p>

<p>Countess Tolstoy had been upset when her husband
gave up writing novels, for they brought in a lot of
money; and now, with their largely increased family,
their income, instead of becoming more, became less.
Tolstoy, in a letter to his wife on this subject, says:</p>

<p class="small">... but I cannot help repeating that our happiness or
unhappiness cannot in the least depend on whether we
lose or acquire something, but only what we ourselves are.
Now if we left Kostenka (one of their children) a million,
would he be happier?... What our life together is, with
our joys and sorrows, will appear to our children real
life, but neither languages, nor diplomas, nor society, and
still less money, make our happiness or unhappiness, and
therefore the question how much our income shrinks cannot
occupy me.</p>

<p>Tolstoy finally satisfied himself by giving up his
estates to his family. The house itself he left to the
youngest, Ivan. This was a tradition in the family,
Tolstoy, as his mother’s youngest son, having inherited
Yasnaya Polyana.</p>

<p>This little boy, who was born when Tolstoy was
quite old, promised to be very remarkable, and his
father took more interest in him than any of his other
children. The child Ivan understood things just as
his father did. When one day his mother said to him,
“Ivan, Yasnaya is yours,” he was very angry and<span class="pagenum">295</span>
stamped his foot passionately, crying “Don’t say that
Yasnaya Polyana is mine! everything is everyone
else’s.” The child died when he was seven, and it
was a most bitter grief to Tolstoy. But Masha, his
second daughter, was a comfort to him; she took her
father’s side when she was only fifteen, and though
she was very delicate, she used all the strength she
had in working for the poor, looking after the peasants’
wives and doing their work for them when they
were ill, minding the children and cleaning and
cooking.</p>

<p>Many people blame Countess Tolstoy for not seeing
eye to eye with her husband, but I think it would
have been a very great deal to expect of any woman,
that she should discard all the habits of a lifetime
and renounce everything she had been accustomed to,
to change her way of living and of bringing up her
children. She describes her feelings very well in a letter
to her sister, saying that her husband is a leader,
one who goes ahead of the crowd pointing the way
men should go. “But I am the crowd,” she says;
“I live in its current, and see the light of the lamp
which every leader, and Leo of course, carries, and
I acknowledge it to be the light. But I cannot go
faster; I am held by the crowd and by my surroundings
and habits.”</p>

<p>Countess Tolstoy also felt that her husband was
wasting himself; he had a genius for writing novels,
and he deliberately gave up writing them and occu<span class="pagenum">296</span>pied
himself instead with log-splitting, reaping, and
making boots which anybody could do, and do better.
It was tiresome of him to play at being “Robinson
Crusoe,” as Countess Tolstoy expressed it.</p>

<p>No doubt he was provoking, but though Tolstoy
and his wife sometimes quarreled, they were devoted
to one another all the same, as may be seen by the
very delightful quotation out of a letter of Countess
Tolstoy’s to her husband.</p>


<p class="small">All at once I pictured you vividly to myself, and a sudden
flood of tenderness rose in me. There is something in
you so wise, kind, naïve, and obstinate, and it is all lit
up by that tender interest for every one natural to you
alone, and by your look that reaches to people’s souls.</p>

<p>Sometimes Tolstoy had to accompany his family
to Moscow. This became the regular arrangement
in the winter, when his daughter Tanya grew up and
began to go to balls and parties. Countess Tolstoy
was always very energetic, arranging their flat and
calling upon people who would ask her daughter to
parties.</p>

<p>Tolstoy, after living in the country, found the artificiality
of town life almost unbearable, and the luxury
of the circle they lived in was to him torture. He
had to occupy himself in order to bear it. One winter
he spent his time taking a census of people in the
poorest part of Moscow.</p>

<p>He was so horrified at the appalling misery he came<span class="pagenum">297</span>
across that he wanted to run away. He knew poverty
in the country, but he had never seen anything like
the poverty he came across in the town. Writing
about it, he says:</p>



<p class="small">I could not look at our own or anybody else’s drawing-room,
or a clean, well-spread dining-table, or a carriage
with well-fed coachman and horses, or shops or theaters
without a feeling of profound irritation.</p>

<p>It was because he had seen the other side of the
picture. And unfortunately there always is another
side to the picture.</p>

<p>He saw this side by side with the wretched
lodging-houses he had been visiting, filled with cold,
hungry, dreadful people, and one he felt was the result
of the other.</p>

<p>His son says the look of suffering on his father’s
face at that time he shall never forget.</p>

<p>He was simply overcome with pity and with shame
and indignation that our civilization can permit such
things. So he went back to Yasnaya alone, and feeling
ill with despair; he took things to heart in an
extraordinary way. But gradually the peace and
loneliness of the country comforted him, and he set
to work on a book about his experiences with the poor
in Moscow, and called it “What Then Must We Do?”
He simply wrote down what he had seen and heard,
and asked what we were to do to destroy what is in
truth slavery—starving people struggling to live and<span class="pagenum">298</span>
driven to crime by their miserable conditions, while
others have riches and luxury, even throwing their
superfluous food to the dogs and enjoying the fruit
of other people’s labor.</p>

<p>It was impossible for Tolstoy to have any respect
for civilization as such, unless it really helped men.
He judged it fairly by what it did and found it wanting.
He longed to see real progress, not merely
mechanical progress. He did not call progress making
battleships, inventing flying machines, or electricity,
or explosives if people’s hearts remained hard. He
wanted to see a spiritual progress, people being kind
and helpful to one another.</p>

<p>The root of all the evil lay in man’s selfishness, he
thought, and the corruption of Governments: these
he considered existed only for the benefit of the rich.
We must remember that the Russian Government at
that time was one of the most backward of so-called
civilized Powers, and what we call representative government
did not exist at all, but a government by a
few for the few.</p>

<p>Tolstoy also set himself to the great work he had
dreamt of doing as a young man, that of separating
the true from the false in the teachings of the Church.
The Greek or the Russian Church does not differ fundamentally
in its doctrines from the Roman Catholic
or Protestant churches.</p>

<p>Tolstoy saw that man needed some religion or chart
to guide him through life, and being himself pro<span class="pagenum">299</span>foundly
religious by nature, he did not, like Voltaire,
merely scoff and destroy, but tried also to build up
and to construct something really tangible and helpful
to human beings.</p>

<p>The truth he believed lay in the teaching of Christ.
“If you wish to understand the truth,” Tolstoy said,
“read the Gospels”; and the book he wrote on the
Gospels is an explanation of Christ’s teaching. He
asked himself, were the things that children and ignorant
people taught true? and if they were not they
should be exposed publicly. Every honest man should
speak out. But people he saw were so confused in
their minds about religion that they thought it must
be supernatural, senseless, and incomprehensible, or
it wasn’t religion.</p>

<p>Tolstoy wanted to make it a real and living force.
He told the peasants in his books that God was not
the cruel, revengeful, punishing Person they had been
taught to believe Him; that He did not go about
hardening people’s hearts and directing them to murder,
and that they would not go to Hell for being unbaptized.
On the contrary, he told them that God
was good and that every human being, as the son of
God, was good too, and could increase, by loving goodness,
the divine in himself, by loving others as himself
and by acting toward everybody as you would
they should act toward you. But to kill another or
abuse him, or to profit at the expense of any man,
this was what made misery in the world. Tolstoy<span class="pagenum">300</span>
preached that all men are equal, as Christ had, and
that nothing can be done by force or by violence, but
only by love.</p>

<p>The Church in Russia was able to exercise a sort
of inquisition, employing people to spy on suspected
free-thinkers all over the country. There existed at
the time, about a hundred miles from Moscow, a Bastille,
or fortress, where persons objected to or suspected
by the Russian Church, were shut up. In its
dark and damp dungeons innocent people would be
left for many years, sometimes forgotten altogether.
Tolstoy would most certainly have been arrested and
probably sent there, if he had not been an aristocrat
with an aunt at court who pleaded for him with the
Czar. As it was, he was excommunicated by the Holy
Synod, the head of the Russian Church.</p>

<p>Tolstoy was proving dangerous, his influence was
beginning to be felt; he was undermining the power
of the Church and State by showing the poor people
that they have a right to live and that all men are
equal; that Christ had said so, and that the Church
has no right to misrepresent His words.</p>

<p>Tolstoy’s books were no longer allowed in libraries;
newspapers were forbidden to mention any meetings
held in his favor. Telegraph offices actually refused
to take messages of sympathy sent him, though abusive
telegrams arrived quite punctually.</p>

<p>During a terrible famine in Russia, when Tolstoy
and his family worked night and day and gave all<span class="pagenum">301</span>
they possessed to the starving peasants, the priests
tried to frighten them and preached against Tolstoy,
saying he was Antichrist and they should not eat his
food.</p>

<p>But the excommunication of Tolstoy had really
quite the opposite effect to what was intended. It
shocked the whole world, and Tolstoy’s name was
received with more and more sympathy.</p>

<p>The views he expressed and the books he wrote
had greater influence than ever before. The Russian
people themselves seemed to realize that they possessed
one of the greatest moral teachers in the world.
But as the people of Russia became freer in their
views and less subservient to authority, so in proportion
the Government became harder and tightened
its hold upon them. Tolstoy had not hitherto written
on political life, but the cruel repression of all forms
of liberty by violence roused him at the end of his
life to write against the Government of his country
a tragic letter which he published in the European
papers, entitled: “I can keep silent no longer.” He
said his life was made unendurable by the suffering
of his people, and he begs all to cease from hatred
and revenge.</p>

<p>Mr. Aylmer Maude, Tolstoy’s English biographer,
visited the great man at Yasnaya Polyana towards the
end of his life. He says what struck him most then
about Tolstoy was his sympathy and kindness more
than his intellect. He had mellowed with age, and<span class="pagenum">302</span>
from having been impatient, violent in argument, and
often obstinate and unjust, he had become patient
and gentle, though he was still intensely alive and
caring as ardently for things as most people of twenty-five.</p>

<p>The atmosphere he created round him in his old
age was peculiarly peaceful, and yet a lively and intelligent
interest was taken by every one in everything.
The influence of Tolstoy seemed to make all
who came into contact with him kind and simple.
There were no shams anywhere. Tolstoy had not
forced his views on his children, as he was afraid
they might follow him insincerely. He wanted them
to be completely free and sincere.</p>

<p>When he was eighty-two Tolstoy left his home.
His reasons for doing so are not quite clear, and
we must form our own conclusions about it. A letter
written to his wife some years before, to be opened
after his death, explains a good deal.</p>

<p>Tolstoy wanted to devote his last days entirely to
God. He wanted complete solitude and peace, in
order to avoid at the end any sort of discord between
his life and his beliefs. If he had talked about this
plan, and told his family, there would have been discussions
and perhaps quarrels, and he could not bear
that. So he decided to slip away quietly without any
one knowing. In the letter he explained that it would
not mean that he was angry with his wife or any one
else: indeed, he could not bear the idea of giving her<span class="pagenum">303</span>
pain. He said he should lovingly remember what his
wife had been to him. But when the time came he
was very weak and had been near death several times.
He confided his secret plan to his youngest daughter
Alexandra, for she, since his favorite daughter Masha
had died a few years before, had been his companion
and confidante. So one snowy night at the end of
October she helped him to depart. He went with a
doctor friend of his who had been living in the house
for some time past.</p>

<p>His first wish was to visit his old sister and to
take farewell of her. She was living in a convent,
and seeing her ending her days so happily and peacefully,
he wished he might have been able to enter a
monastery, if only it had not been necessary to believe
in the Church. On his journey by train—he had not
yet made up his mind where he would settle down—he
caught cold and had to stop at a little wayside station.
There, in the station-master’s house, the cold
developed into pneumonia, and as he was very weak
there was little hope of his recovery. After a week
of suffering he passed peacefully away, surrounded
by his family and friends.</p>

<p>Before the end came, a telegram arrived from a
high dignitary of the Church urging Tolstoy to return
to the bosom of the Church. But it was not shown
to him, for a similar message had been sent some
years before when Tolstoy was very ill, and he had
said, “How is it they do not understand that even<span class="pagenum">304</span>
when one is face to face with death, two and two still
make four?”</p>

<p>Hundreds of people had flocked to the little country
station when it was known that Tolstoy lay ill
there. It was an extraordinary scene. Peasants who
loved him jostled newspaper men who wanted the
latest news. Photographers and police officers, literary
people and aristocrats were there, and messages
and telegrams arrived from all over the world. Multitudes
of his poor peasants came to his funeral, and
many wept aloud.</p>

<p>“Our great Leo is dead,” cried one. “Long live our
great Leo’s spirit.”</p>

<p>Tolstoy’s body was laid where he had wished to lie,
on the spot where his brother Nicholas had buried
the green stick on which was written the great secret
it was Tolstoy’s purpose in life to discover.</p>

<p>What was the secret of Tolstoy’s power?</p>

<p>Every one who came near him seemed to feel it,
and most of those who read his books. It is true that
there still exists a certain number of people who recognize
him only as a novelist. These are generally
among the upper classes and among literary people
who are impatient with him for having neglected his
art. If it had not been for his novels it is probable
that his influence would not have been nearly so far-reaching.
It is doubtful whether fashionable people
would have taken any notice of his serious books at
all. But the fact that he had written “Anna Kare<span class="pagenum">305</span>nina”
and had made a great name, roused their curiosity
and they read his indictments against society,
governments, and the Church with some interest, and
many have gradually come under his spell.</p>

<p>It was Tolstoy’s profound sincerity and his warm
heart that made people love him. They saw how
passionate was his wish to make the world a better
place, how he hated small, mean things, and worshiped
goodness and truth. He had immense courage,
and fame or the praise of men by the time he
was middle-aged meant nothing to him. But he confesses
that in his younger days he looked for and
enjoyed success. His art had been a temptation to
him, and that was one of the reasons why he would
have nothing more to do with it.</p>

<p>Tolstoy was above all things a human being: indeed,
it was his special characteristic. Being so, he was
sometimes inconsistent and swayed by his moods and
his likes and dislikes, which makes his critics say
he did not practise his doctrine of love. He asked
people to turn the other cheek and love their
enemies, while he himself found it almost impossible
to be agreeable to disagreeable people or to
stupid people, and he never succeeded in tolerating
those whom he considered responsible for the
evils of our social system, rulers, politicians, and
policemen.</p>

<p>When absorbed in thought he was forgetful and
inconsiderate; he did not mean to be selfish, but his<span class="pagenum">306</span>
wife’s sufferings and what people who lived with him
had to put up with did not strike him. He was impetuous,
especially in his younger days, and he was
always making resolutions which he failed very often
to carry out. But all great idealists must suffer
from this; it is infinitely better than having no ideals
at all and making no mistakes. If a man with Tolstoy’s
ideals could carry them all out, he would be
the perfect man, and Tolstoy was far from being that.
But no one could be more humble or more ready to
blame himself, and as he grew older he more and more
succeeded in practising in his life what he preached
to others.</p>

<p>Tolstoy believed in God, and in the spiritual element
that is in all men and women and which all,
he insisted, must cherish and try to increase.</p>

<p>He believed that all men are equal as Christ did,
and that all are brothers, so there should be no such
thing as rivalry among nations, and no wars. If a
man is not bent on money-making, on stealing and
grasping for himself and taking away from others,
if he only desires to treat them as he wishes they
would treat himself, then will force become unnecessary.
This idea may also be applied to States, for
wars arise out of their jealousies and rivalry, in the
search after power and wealth.</p>

<p>Tolstoy saw that much wickedness and misery came
out of poverty, and a great deal through riches: one
is often the cause of the other, and the unequal dis<span class="pagenum">307</span>tribution
of wealth is one of the greatest problems
of our civilization.</p>

<p>But Tolstoy says, could the meaning of renunciation,
of giving up to others, be really understood, the
battle would be won, and the need of force would not
exist. The only crime is for man to act inhumanly
to man. A change of heart is what Tolstoy pleads
for, and every man and woman, he says, can do something
to help, by example and having a purpose in
life. “For life,” he says in a letter to his son, “is
a place of service, and in that service one has to suffer
at times a great deal that is hard to bear, but more
often to experience a great deal of joy. But that joy
can only be real if people look upon their life as a
service and have a definite object in life outside themselves
and their personal affairs.”</p>

<p>On seeing the terrible sight of capital punishment
in France, Tolstoy wrote these striking words:</p>



<p class="small">When I saw the head separate from the body and how
they both jumped into the box at the same moment, I understood
not with my mind but with my whole being, that
no theory of the reasonableness of our present progress
can justify this deed, and that though everybody from
the creation of the world, on whatever theory had held
it to be necessary, I know it to be unnecessary and bad,
and therefore the arbiter of what is good and evil is not
what people say and do and is not progress, but is my
heart and I.</p>

<p>Who is to be the judge of what is right or wrong?
asks Tolstoy, and answers, “A man’s own soul.” A<span class="pagenum">308</span>
man, he says, must not fear to stand alone. Now
the fear of standing alone is not always cowardice;
often a man has too little confidence in himself. In
answer to the promptings of his heart or conscience
he will say, “Perhaps I am wrong: after all, the
majority think differently from what I do; they are
probably right, for what am I?” But it is very seldom
that a man’s conscience will lead him astray, and
if he feels that a thing is bad or cruel, he should not
stifle or ignore the instinct, but, on the contrary,
trust and believe in it, for it is a divine thing created
in man for his own safeguarding to direct and help
him through the difficult ways of life.</p>

<p>Tolstoy had much in common with W. L. Garrison,
whom he greatly admired, and wrote a preface to a
Life of him written by a Russian. For both recognized
no authority but a man’s own heart and conscience,
both set themselves to the task of rousing
people to a better understanding by moral persuasion,
both detested force.</p>

<p>It is easy to say that Tolstoy was vague, unpractical,
and even absurd in the things he taught. Some people
think he was quite mistaken; those who honestly believe
in force and government by a few privileged
people must naturally think so. Tolstoy was very
extreme, but what he did was to give people a higher,
more spiritual ideal, to show them that life may be
a noble thing.</p>

<p>Tolstoy realized as he grew older that we cannot<span class="pagenum">309</span>
be perfect all at once. Therefore he says, if you cannot
love another as yourself, go as far as you can in
that direction; if you cannot live in complete simplicity,
live rather more simply, and so on.</p>

<p>By degrees we may be able to get somewhere nearer
Tolstoy’s ideals, especially if we believe that we are
naturally good, and not, as many of us have been
taught, “by nature born in sin and the children
of wrath.”</p>

<p class="right">
D. P.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Since this was written a great change has come
about in Russia, which may affect the whole of civilized
Europe.</p>

<p>The People of Russia—the Workers—have risen
against their rulers, and deposed the Czar and his
advisers.</p>

<p>It is early days yet to say what the final outcome
of the Revolution will be; but the upheaval is a step
toward freedom, and behind it the spirit of Tolstoy
moves. He, above all others, helped to sow the seed
of the Russian Revolution, and maybe of other revolutions
yet to come. What joy and thankfulness would
have filled his great heart could he have seen the
germination of this seed—the downfall of Czarism and
the dawning of freedom for the People of Russia!</p>

through child rhymes and jingles to more mature
nonsense verse; then come fairy verses and Christmas
poems; then nature verse and favorite rhymed stories; then
through the trumpet and drum period (where an attempt
is made to teach true patriotism) to the final appeal of
“Life Lessons” and “A Garland of Gold” (the great
poems for all ages).</p>

<p>This arrangement secures sequence of sentiment and a
sort of cumulative appeal. Nearly all the children’s
classics are included, and along with them a body of verse
not so well known but almost equally deserving. There
are many real “finds,” most of which have never before
appeared in any anthology.</p>

<p>Mr. Stevenson has banished doleful and pessimistic
verse, and has dwelt on hope, courage, cheerfulness and
helpfulness. The book should serve, too, as an introduction
to the greater poems, informing taste for them and
appreciation of them, against the time when the boy or
girl, grown into youth and maiden, is ready to swim out
into the full current of English poetry.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If

without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
